1. This Frame is mainly used for automate the manual test cases and do regression test. Because GlobalSight is a really big web system. So When it updated, a lot of test cases need be re-run. Such task cost too much time and resources. So automation is very useful and really need in such situation. After investigate so many web app automation test tools. Finally, we decided to use selenium as our first choice. Selenium is open sourced, more powerful, easy to use and it's the most popular open source web testing tool.

2. Because we build our automation system from scratch, so at the beginning, this system will contains many bugs and disadvantages. But We believe it will become better and better with your help. So when you find bugs and dis-advantages, please tell us freely. :)
