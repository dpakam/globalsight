        <h1>Method 
 Set Editor</h1>
        <p class="para">
            <MadCap:concept term="Method set editor" />Use the Method Set Editor from the Project window, Run Samples, 
 or Review to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Create or modify a method 
 set by specifying an existing instrument method, processing method, report 
 method, and/or export method. Method sets may contain different information 
 depending on how they are used to perform specific operations. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Create derived channels, 
 which are chromatograms calculated using (or derived from) raw data from 
 a detector, which are then manipulated during processing. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Define a GPCV/LS channel 
 set (GPCV, GPCV-LS, GPC-LS processing), which is a combination of data 
 acquired from the concentration channel, up to two viscometer channels 
 and LS channels used in a method set to process GPCV/LS data. The channel 
 set allows you to process multiple channels of an injection for one GPCV/LS 
 result.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p class="para">The Method Set Editor includes the following components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Menu bar – Displays command 
 menus for using the Method Set Editor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 When using the Method Set Editor from Review, it uses the menus in Review.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Toolbar 
 – Displays shortcut icons for commonly used menu commands in the Method 
 Set Editor.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Method 
 Set tree – An expandable and collapsible list of data channels, derived 
 channels, and GPCV/LS channel sets (if the GPCV option is enabled). You 
 can drag channels from the tree into the Channel table (as described below).</li>
            <li class="listbull">Instrument 
 method – Lists instrument methods in the project to use in the method 
 set. The instrument method defines available data channels. If you modify 
 the contents of the specified instrument method, the Edit button (to the 
 right of the list) accesses the Instrument Method window.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Default 
 processing method – Lists processing methods in the project. The default 
 processing method is used for all channels in the Method Set tree. Select 
 the default processing method to use in the method set from this list. 
 If you modify the contents of the specified processing method, the Edit 
 button (to the right of the list in the Method Set Editor) accesses the 
 Processing Method window.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Default 
 report methods – Lists report methods in the project (Individual and Summary 
 By Injection report methods only). The default report method is used for 
 all channels in the Method Set tree. Select the default report method 
 to use in the method set from this list. If you modify the contents of 
 the specified report method, the Edit button (to the right of the list) 
 accesses the Report Publisher.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Channel table – Allows 
 you to process and generate reports for different data channels using 
 different methods. The channels list associated with the selected instrument 
 method (and displayed in the Method Set tree) includes data, derived channels, 
 and GPCV/LS channel sets. The Channel table specifies individual channels 
 along with processing and/or report methods to be applied to each selected 
 channel. Selections in this table override the default processing method 
 and/or report method selections. If this table is empty, all channel data 
 is processed and reported using specified default methods. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you enter a channel name in the Channel Name field instead of selecting 
 one from the list, it must name an existing derived channel or one you 
 derived and then saved. You cannot extract a chromatogram without a derived 
 channel.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Export 
 method – Specifies export data in ASCII, AIA, or Windows Metafile format.</li>
            <li class="listbull">PDA 3D 
 Blank Subtraction – Subtracts a labeled PDA 3D channel (a blank) from 
 a PDA 3D standard or sample.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Save Extracted 
 Channels – Saves extracted 2D channels from 3D chromatograms. Processing 
 occurs on the 2D extracted channel. 3D processing is not performed.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Delete 3D Channel After 
 Extraction – Saves extracted 2D channels from a 3D chromatogram, then 
 deletes the 3D chromatogram from the Empower database.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Expected mass processing 
 – Specifies the processing method that contains the injection-based expected 
 mass information this method set will use.</li>
        </ul>
