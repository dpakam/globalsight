        <h1>Method 
 Set wizard – Specify Extraction Type page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to specify the type of PDA or MS derived channel 
 to create for your application. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Single 
 Wavelength (PDA) – Created by extracting a single wavelength. The software 
 prompts you for the wavelength.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Single 
 Mass (MS) – Created by extracting a single mass. The software prompts 
 you for the mass value.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Max Plot 
 (PDA and MS) – Creates a chromatogram in which each data point is plotted 
 at its maximum absorbance wavelength (PDA) or maximum intensity (MS). 
 The software prompts you for starting and ending wavelengths (PDA) or 
 masses (MS).</li>
            <li class="listbull">Total 
 Plot (PDA and MS) – Averages absorbance values of a specific range of 
 wavelengths (PDA) or sums intensities of a specific range of masses (MS). 
 The software prompts you for starting and ending wavelengths (PDA) or 
 masses (MS).</li>
            <li class="listbull">Ratio 
 Plot (PDA and MS) – Represents a ratio of the absorbance at two wavelengths 
 (PDA) or of the intensity at two masses (MS). The software prompts you 
 for starting and ending wavelengths (PDA) or masses (MS), as well as the 
 minimum value.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Total Ion Chromatogram 
 (MS) – Where each point in the y-axis represents the sum of all ion intensities 
 acquired in the spectrum at the time indicated by the x-axis.</li>
        </ul>
