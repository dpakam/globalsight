        <h1>Edit Custom 
 Field dialog box</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this dialog box to modify custom fields.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Changes made to a custom field will not affect previously created results. 
 The version of the custom field used in the result is saved and associated 
 with the result.</p>
        <h2>Field type</h2>
        <h3>Sample</h3>
        <p class="para">Custom sample parameter or describes the sample (for example, 
 lot number, analyst name, or patient ID). All data types are available 
 for use with this field type.</p>
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p class="para">Custom calculation of a result-level parameter (such as the 
 total area of all peaks with a %Area less than or equal to 2% = Sum(Area*LTE(%Area,2.0)) 
 All data types are available for use with this field type.</p>
        <h3>Peak</h3>
        <p class="para">Custom calculation of a peak-level parameter (including an 
 interpeak calculation capability). All data types are available for use 
 with this field type.</p>
        <h3>Sample set</h3>
        <p class="para">Sample set parameters (for example, column type, column lot 
 number, plant location, and batch lot number). All data types are available 
 for use with this field type.</p>
        <h3>Component</h3>
        <p class="para">Identifier pertaining to a particular peak (for example, 
 label claim). The Real data type is available for use with this field 
 type.</p>
        <h3>Distribution</h3>
        <p class="para">Custom calculation of a distribution slice-level parameter 
 for GPC/V data. Real, Bool, and Enum data types are available for use 
 with this field type.</p>
        <h2>Data type</h2>
        <h3>Integer (0)</h3>
        <p class="para">Whole number entry (without fractional parts).</p>
        <h3>Real (0.0)</h3>
        <p class="para">Floating-point number entry (can contain a fraction).</p>
        <h3>Text</h3>
        <p class="para">Alphanumeric entry.</p>
        <h3>Date</h3>
        <p class="para">Date entry entered by the user or from an external source 
 (for example, a peak field).</p>
        <h3>Boolean</h3>
        <p class="para">For a Calculated Data Source, specifies an entry resulting 
 from a Boolean logic statement (for example, a statement using the operators 
 GT (greater than), LT (less than), GTE (greater than or equal to), and 
 so on). For a Keyboard or External Data Source, you can enter two strings, 
 which represent a True or False condition.</p>
        <h3>Enum</h3>
        <p class="para">For a Calculated Data Source, specifies an enumerated entry 
 used with Boolean functions. An enumerated entry is a series of Boolean 
 statements separated by commas (,), any one of which can be true. The 
 first true statement determines the value of the custom field. For a Keyboard 
 or External Data Source, you can enter up to 999 definition strings.</p>
        <h2>Data source</h2>
        <h3>Keyboard</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies to enter the field value through the keyboard.</p>
        <h3>External</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies to provide the field value outside the Empower 
 database (for example, the Empower Toolkit).</p>
        <h3>Calculated</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies to calculate the field value by Empower software 
 using a formula that you define. If you selected Text or Date for the 
 data type, this parameter is disabled.</p>
        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p class="para">Name of the selected custom field.</p>
        <h2>Width</h2>
        <p class="para">Maximum number of alphanumeric characters that can be printed 
 or entered in a field. If applicable, include the decimal point.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 1 to 249, depending on data type</p>
        <h2>Precision</h2>
        <p class="para">For the Real data type, specifies the number of digits printed 
 to the right of the decimal point.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0 to 14</p>
        <h2>Min</h2>
        <p class="para">For keyboard-entered integers and the Real data type, defines 
 the minimum value for the field.</p>
        <h2>Max</h2>
        <p class="para">For keyboard-entered integers and the Real data type, defines 
 the maximum value for the field.</p>
        <h2>Translation definition table</h2>
        <p class="para">If the data type is Bool, two rows are displayed, one for 
 each possible logical outcome.</p>
        <h3>Value</h3>
        <p class="para">Logical values for the field. For example, 0 (False), 1 (True).</p>
        <h3>Translation</h3>
        <p class="para">Text translation that you enter for the Enumeration Value. 
 For example, "Bad" for 0 (False) or "Good" for 1 (True).</p>
        <p class="para">If the data type is Enum and the field is calculated, the 
 table displays one row for each comma-separated Boolean expression in 
 the ENUM function. In this case, you cannot add or remove rows. The Enum 
 Value column is read-only. The Translation column is initially empty. 
 You enter the text translations for each Enum value.</p>
        <p class="para">If the data type is Enum and the field is not calculated 
 (Data Source is External or Keyboard), you can add or remove rows as appropriate. 
 You can also insert rows, drag and drop rows, and so on. Each time you 
 add a row, the software refreshes the Enum column to ensure increasing 
 the order starting from 0. Only the translations appear to move.</p>
        <h3>Value</h3>
        <p class="para">Number of the enumerated field starting at 0.</p>
        <h3>Translation</h3>
        <p class="para">Description of the value.</p>
        <h2>User entry required</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies that an entry is required in the custom field during 
 sample loading (in Run Samples, the Sample Set Method Editor, or the Alter 
 Sample window) or when you import data. If an entry is required, you <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> proceed with sample loading 
 until you enter a value for the field.</p>
        <h2>Default value</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies a default value for the custom sample identifier. 
 This default value appears in the custom field if a user entry is not 
 required. If the data type is Bool or Enum, the default string appears 
 at the top of the Translation column in the Translation Definition table.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 For Bool and Enum data types, you can enter a default value (for example, 
 "Not Set" or leave the default blank) even though the default 
 value is not defined in either the Boolean or the enumerated statement. 
 If no Enumeration or Boolean calculation evaluates True, the default value 
 remains as the value of the custom field. Use an appropriate default value 
 to ensure proper error control.</p>
        <h2>Calculation criteria</h2>
        <h2>Search order</h2>
        <p class="para">Order you want the database searched.</p>
        <h3>Result set first</h3>
        <p class="para">Intersample calculations are performed on the current result 
 set <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>. If no result is found 
 and the label is specified in an intersample label, the search continues 
 outside the current result set to the current project. If the intersample 
 calculation is a summary type (SUM), the search continues both inside 
 and outside the current result set. If the label is not specified, the 
 search ends with the current result set.</p>
        <h3>Result set only</h3>
        <p class="para">Intersample calculations are performed <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> 
 in the current result set. If the current result is not part of a result 
 set, the custom field will not produce a value.</p>
        <h3>Outside first</h3>
        <p class="para">Intersample calculations are performed using results outside 
 the current result set <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>. 
 If an intersample label specifies a label, a search is performed on all 
 results in the current project first. If no result is found, the search 
 is performed on the current result set (if there is a current result set 
 available). If the intersample calculation is a summary type (SUM), the 
 search continues both inside and outside the current result set. If there 
 is no label specified in an intersample label, the search is performed 
 on the current result set only (if available). </p>
        <h3>Outside only</h3>
        <p class="para">Intersample calculations are performed using results from 
 outside the current result set. If an intersample label does not specify 
 a label, a search criteria conflict occurs and the custom field will not 
 produce a value.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If no intersample label is specified, Outside Only has no effect.</p>
        <h2>All or nothing</h2>
        <p class="para">Indicates whether the All or Nothing flag is enabled. If 
 selected, the field will not generate a value on subtractions or additions 
 unless all values are present.</p>
        <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use as</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies how the data type Enum or Bool in the Data and 
 Type Selection page is used in the calculation.</p>
        <h3>Position</h3>
        <p class="para">Uses the position (index) of the selected item in the Translation 
 definition table.</p>
        <h3>Text </h3>
        <p class="para">Uses the selected item as a text string.</p>
        <h3>Value</h3>
        <p class="para">Interprets the selected item as a value. </p>
        <h2>Calculated field formula</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays a custom formula you defined when the custom field 
 was created or that you can create using the Edit Formula dialog box.</p>
        <h2>Edit formula</h2>
        <p class="para">Activates the New Custom Field Wizard – Formula Entry page, 
 allowing you to edit or create a custom formula.</p>
