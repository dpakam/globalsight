        <h1>Create 
 a Condition dialog box</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this dialog box to specify a condition for the selected 
 view filter table column. A condition typically consists of an operator 
 (for example, Equals) and a reference value (for example, 5094) that, 
 in combination, limit the data that appears in the view to which the view 
 filter is applied. </p>
        <p class="para">The operator field lists available operators; the fields 
 to the right are for entry or selection of reference values. The field 
 on the far right is active only if you choose Between as the operator. 
 Clicking OK closes the dialog box and enters the specified condition in 
 the view filter table column.</p>
