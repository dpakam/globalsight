        <h1>New Sample 
 Set Method template – User Prompts page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to define the total number of samples you plan 
 to run, set the starting tray or carousel position for the first sample, 
 and enter values for custom fields to identify your samples. This page 
 appears when you choose to create a sample set method using a previously 
 created sample set method template. </p>
        <h2>Number of sample vials</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the total number of sample vials in the tray or 
 carousel.</p>
        <h2>Vial starting position in tray</h2>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the tray position number that 
 contains the first sample vial for the sample set. Valid entries: 1 to 
 120 for the Waters 2690 Separations Module, 1 to 96 for Waters 717/717plus 
 Autosamplers, 1 to 100 for the HP 5890 and 6890 GC autosamplers, and 1 
 to 999 for other non-Waters autosamplers.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Specifies the tray position number that 
 contains the first sample vial for the sample set. Valid entry: 1 to 96 
 for Waters 717/717plus Autosamplers</p>
        <h2>Define the plates to be used with this sample set method / Define Plates 
 (button)</h2>
        <p class="para">For systems configured for plate operation, clicking the 
 Define Plates button displays the Define Plates for Sample Set Method 
 dialog box, where you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Select the pre-defined 
 plate types from which injections are to be made</li>
            <li class="listbull">Select the position of 
 the plates within the autosampler</li>
            <li class="listbull">Activate the range of 
 available vial/well locations (from which injections are to be made) for 
 each selected plate </li>
            <li class="listbull">Specify the Plate Sequencing 
 Mode (injection order) for the vial/well locations</li>
            <li class="listbull">Optionally create a new 
 plate type</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 The plate definitions you set are not saved as part of the sample set 
 method template. They are used only to establish a valid plate starting 
 position (when using the template to create a sample set method).</p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Identify today’s samples</h2>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Specifies or modifies values for each 
 available custom field. Enter or modify the custom field value(s) in the 
 Value column of the table, as required.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 The fields on this page appear only if they were specified for user entry 
 when the sample set method template was created.</p>
        <p class="para">After making your entries, click Finish to complete the sample 
 set method and load the sample set method into the Samples table.</p>
