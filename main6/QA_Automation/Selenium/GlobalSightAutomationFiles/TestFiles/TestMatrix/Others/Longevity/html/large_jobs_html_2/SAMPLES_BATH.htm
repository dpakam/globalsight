        <h1>Bath A or B 
 Samples page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to enter sample parameters for Bath A and/or 
 Bath B. This page appears only when you select a dissolution type in the 
 Select Sample Set Method Type page of the Sample Set Method wizard. </p>
        <h2>First vial position</h2>
        <p class="para">The starting vial position for a range of vials to be filled. 
 For example, for 8 syringes and 5 sample transfers, you need 40 vial positions. 
 If you specify 9 as the first vial position, vials 9 to 48 are filled. 
 </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 with the 2690D/2695D, 1–120; without the 2690D/2695D, 1–999</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 1</p>
        <h3>2690D/2695D Considerations</h3>
        <p class="para">The position of the first sample vial must be divisible by 
 6 or 8 (depending on the number of syringes in the Waters Transfer Module) 
 plus 1. For example, in a 6-syringe system, you can specify #13 as the 
 first sample vial position (12 + 1), but not #11.</p>
        <p class="para">Sample transfers cannot occur between carousels. The 2690D/2695D 
 allows up to three for an 8-syringe system and four transfers per carousel 
 for a 6-syringe system. However, it does not allow the transfer of four 
 samples to one carousel and four samples to another carousel from the 
 same sample transfer.</p>
        <h2>Transfer times</h2>
        <p class="para">Click a row in the Transfer Times table to specify the time 
 (in minutes) to transfer each sample. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 The maximum number of vial positions in the carousels is 120. </p>
        <p class="para">If you have a 2690D/2695D and run at least one dissolution 
 test, you cannot edit the transfer times. If you do not have a 2690D/2695D 
 and run at least one dissolution test, you can edit the transfers times 
 from the Alter Samples menu.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 1.00 to 59999.99 with no more than 20 entries in ascending order and no 
 duplicate times.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Minimum 
 entry:</span> 1 at 1:00</p>
        <h2>Dissolution test duration</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the total length of time (in minutes) to run the 
 dissolution test. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 1.00 to 59999.00 min</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 60.00</p>
        <h2>Perform infinity test</h2>
        <p class="para">Runs an infinity test after the timed transfers in a dissolution 
 test finishes. An infinity test<span style="font-style: italic;"> <![CDATA[ ]]></span>spins 
 the apparatus (if applicable, paddles or basket) at 200 rpm (for a Hanson 
 bath v. 2.1 or lower) or 250 rpm (for a Hanson bath that is v. 2.1 or 
 higher) for Bath A or B. Enter the length of time (in minutes) you want 
 to perform the infinity test. The high rate of speed allows the dosage 
 form to completely dissolve in the media before another aliquot of sample 
 is transferred to vials.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries

        <h2>Collect all samples before any LC (2690D/2695D only)</h2>
        <p class="para">Transfers all aliquots in the sample set to vials <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> 
 any samples or standards are injected.</p>
        <h2>Offsets bath A or B (2690D/2695D only)</h2>
        <p class="para">If you selected Dissolution (Baths A and B) in the Select 
 Sample Set Method Type page, Bath A and B Offset appear on the Bath B 
 Samples page. </p>
