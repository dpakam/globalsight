        <h1>LS 
 Calibration wizard - Calibration Constants page</h1>
        <p class="para">This page displays the LS calibration constant and the concentration 
 channel calibration constant calculated during the calibration process. 
 It also indicates whether the concentration channel is connected to an 
 RI detector. </p>
        <p class="para">The two constant fields are always editable and blank if 
 the values are not successfully calculated. You can save the calibration 
 with blank constants. However, if the LS calibration constant is blank, 
 then you cannot calculate molecular weights from LS data because the LS 
 detector was not calibrated. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> The 
 calibration constants must be positive numbers. Zero is not a valid entry.</p>
        <p class="para">If the concentration channel is connected to a calibrated 
 RI detector and the concentration channel constant field contains a value, 
 you can calculate molecular weights from your LS data when you did not 
 enter a concentration during sample loading or in the Alter Sample window. 
 This approach is useful when you do not know the accurate concentration 
 of your sample or you are having solubility problems with your sample.</p>
        <p class="para">Click Finish to close the wizard. If the RI Calibration Constant 
 is calculated, a message box appears asking if you want to copy the RI 
 Calibration Constant to the instrument method. Click Yes.</p>
