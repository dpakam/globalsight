        <h1>Column 
 tab (6890)</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to set the column 1 or column 2 mode and any 
 optional ramped pressure or flow programs. </p>
        <h2>Column information</h2>
        <p class="para">The Length, Diameter, Film Thickness, and Carrier Gas Type 
 fields are populated initially with information read from the 6890 GC 
 system. If you create an instrument method when this information is not 
 available, the Length, Diameter, and Film Thickness fields default to 
 0, the Description and Serial Number fields are empty, and the Gas Type 
 field value defaults to Unknown. </p>
        <p class="para">When the instrument method runs, the Length, Diameter, Film 
 Thickness, Description, and Gas Type fields are sent to the 6890 GC System, 
 overwriting the information in the instrument.</p>
        <h3>Length (m)</h3>
        <p class="para">Length of the column in meters.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0 and 1.00 to 200.00</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="para">Description of the column up to 18 alphanumeric characters.</p>
        <h3>Diameter (<span style="font-family: Symbol;">m</span>m)</h3>
        <p class="para">Column diameter in microns.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0 and 50 to 750</p>
        <h3>Serial number</h3>
        <p class="para">Serial number of the column.</p>
        <h3>Film thickness</h3>
        <p class="para">Film thickness in microns.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0 and 0.1 to 50.0</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Rule:</span> 
 This value must be at least equal to half of the diameter value.</p>
        <h3>Gas type</h3>
        <p class="para">Type of gas.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Helium, Argon / Methane, Oxygen, Air, Argon, and Unknown.</p>
        <h2>Mode</h2>
        <p class="para">Column mode in which carrier gas is to be applied and monitored 
 during a run:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Constant 
 Pressure – Maintains a constant gauge pressure at the head of the column 
 during a run. If column resistance changes, the mass flow rate is adjusted 
 to maintain a constant pressure. This is the default. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Constant 
 Flow – Maintains a constant mass flow rate of carrier gas in the column 
 throughout the run. If column resistance changes, the column head pressure 
 is adjusted to maintain a constant flow. This mode can significantly shorten 
 run times during a ramped temperature program.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Ramped 
 Pressure – Increases the column head gauge pressure according to how you 
 program the Ramp table. When you select this parameter, the Ramp table 
 is activated. By entering values in the table, you can program up to three 
 ramped pressure increases during a run. Refer to Ramp table, below for 
 more information.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Ramped Flow – Increases 
 the mass flow rate in the column according to how you program the Ramp 
 table. When you select this parameter, the Ramp table is activated. By 
 entering values in the table, you can program up to three ramped flow 
 increases during a run. Refer to Ramp Table below for more information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Initial pressure/flow</h2>
        <p class="para">Initial flow rate or pressure value, which depends on your 
 Mode selection. If you selected Constant Flow or Ramped Flow, the units 
 are mL/min. If you selected Constant Pressure or Ramped Pressure, the 
 units are psi.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 0.0.</p>
        <h2>Initial time</h2>
        <p class="para">Length of time (from the start of the run) that the initial 
 ramped flow or pressure value is maintained. If you select Ramped Flow 
 or Ramped Pressure mode and enter Rate, Final (pressure/flow), and Hold 
 Time values for row 1 in the Ramp table, flow or pressure is maintained 
 for the length of time you set for Initial Time, then ramps up using the 
 Rate and Final Pressure/Flow values you selected for row 1 in the Ramp 
 table. If you select Constant Flow or Constant Pressure mode, Initial 
 Time is disabled.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 0.00</p>
        <h2>Ramp table</h2>
        <p class="para">Allows you to program up to three ramped flow or pressure 
 changes of carrier gas during a run. The table is active only when you 
 select Ramped Flow or Ramped Pressure mode. In each row of the table, 
 define:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Rate – 
 Rate of changes in mL/min for flow, or psi/min for pressure. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Final 
 (pressure/flow) – Pressure or flow that you want the ramp to reach. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Hold Time 
 – Length of time during which you want to hold the final pressure or flow 
 value. When this time expires, the software goes on to the next table 
 row (unless this is the last row in the table). </li>
            <li class="listbull">Total 
 Time – Total time as calculated 
 by Empower software. Total Time displayed in the first row is derived 
 from the difference between the Initial Pressure/Flow (at the start of 
 the ramp) and the Final Pressure/Flow (at the end of the ramp) divided 
 by the Rate, plus Hold Time plus the Initial Time. Total Time displayed 
 for subsequent rows is derived from the difference between the Final Pressure/Flow 
 from the previous row and the Final Pressure/Flow for the current row 
 divided by the Rate, plus Hold Time, plus the Total Time from the previous 
 row.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">When the run begins, flow or pressure is maintained at the 
 Initial flow or pressure value for the length of time you entered for 
 Initial Time. At the end of that time, flow or pressure ramps up to the 
 Final Pressure/Flow value at the Rate you set in row 1. Final Pressure/Flow 
 is maintained for the length of time you entered for Hold Time. You can 
 enter values in up to three table rows. The ramp process continues for 
 each row in the table. </p>
        <p class="para"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #425085;" class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If a flow or pressure program ends before the analytical run ends, the 
 flow or pressure remains at the final value.</p>
