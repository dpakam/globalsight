    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>New Sample 
 Set Method wizard – Describe Standard Bracket page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to further define your standards, set the injection 
 volume and number, enter optional standards information, set run time 
 for your standards, and select a method set to be used when you run the 
 standards.</p>
        <h2>Standard information section</h2>
        <p class="para">Use this section to define additional information about your 
 standard injections.</p>
        <h3>Number of standard vials in each group</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the number of standard vials for each group of 
 standards in the tray. The value you specify can refer to a single group 
 of standards at the beginning of the tray, or a separate group of standards 
 before each sample group.</p>
        <h3>Number of levels in each standard group</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the number of levels within each group of single-concentration 
 standards (when you use the autoinjector to make multiple-level injections 
 to vary standard volumes). Each level has a standard vial and an injection 
 volume associated with it (you define these standard vials and injection 
 volumes in the Enter Level Details page of the New Sample Set Method Wizard). 
 This parameter is grayed out if you selected Each Standard Vial Contains 
 a Different Level Standard in the previous wizard page. It must be entered 
 afterwards if you want to average by level. You can define up to 99 different 
 levels in the software. </p>
        <p class="para">When you process a series of standards (using a processing 
 method with the Average By Level parameter enabled), all vials identified 
 with the same level label are averaged together to create a single point 
 in the calibration curve. </p>
        <h3>Number of injections per vial</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the number of standard injections from each standard 
 vial or the number of injections at each level if you selected Different 
 Standard Levels are Created with Different Injection Volumes Using an 
 Autoinjector in the previous wizard page.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are creating a sample set method for dual tower GC operation, you 
 must select the same value for Number of Injections per Vial for both 
 the Front and Back tower to allow for simultaneous injections. To create 
 a dual tower sample set method, you use the wizard twice, once for each 
 tower.</p>
        <h3>Injection volume</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the volume in microliters of the injected sample, 
 valid entries are 0.0 to 29999.9. Note the following considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt;" class="listbull">For Waters autosamplers, 
 small injector loops may omit the maximum volume. Ensure hardware configuration 
 is compatible with your desired injector size.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt;" class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Agilent 1100 autosamplers, 
 the maximum injection volume is the seat capillary volume, plus the syringe 
 size. Ensure that the hardware configuration is specified correctly in 
 your method.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt;" class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Agilent GCs, valid 
 entries are 1 to 5 units. Each unit corresponds to 10 percent of syringe 
 capacity. For example, 2 units of a 25 microliter syringe is 10 microliters. 
 So entering 2 will cause a 10 microliter injection. However, if you are 
 using the optional nanoliter adaptor, these percentages change. Please 
 consult the manufacturer’s documentation to determine the correct setting 
 for injection volume.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Specifies the volume in microliters of 
 the injected sample, valid entries are 0.0 to 29999.9. </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze"><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> Small 
 injector loops may omit the maximum volume. Ensure hardware configuration 
 is compatible with your desired injector size.</p>
        <h3>Run time</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the length of time in minutes to collect data for 
 a standard.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Valid entries:</span> 
 0.0 to 650.0</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are creating a sample set method for dual tower GC operation, you 
 must select the same value for Run Time for both the Front and Back tower 
 to allow for simultaneous injections. To create a dual tower sample set 
 method, you use the wizard twice, once for each tower.</p>
        <h2>Method set section</h2>
        <p class="para">Use this section to define or create the method set used 
 to acquire, process, and/or report data for your standards.</p>
        <h3>Select</h3>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the method set used to acquire, 
 process, and/or report data for the standards. Select the appropriate 
 method set from the drop-down list. If you are using the Pro interface, 
 click Create New if you need to create a new method set. </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Specifies the method set used to acquire, 
 process, and/or report data for the standards. Select the appropriate 
 method set from the drop-down list. </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are creating a sample set method for dual tower GC operation, you 
 must select the same method set for both the Front and Back tower to allow 
 for simultaneous injections. To create a dual tower sample set method, 
 you use the wizard twice, once for each tower.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Create new button (Pro interface only)</h3>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Displays the first page of the New Method 
 Set Wizard, where Empower software interactively leads you through the 
 steps to create a new method set. </p>
        <h3>Options button</h3>
        <p class="para">Displays the Enter Optional Information page, where you can 
 specify a Sample Weight factor, a Dilution factor, a Data Start time, 
 and a Next Injection Delay time for your standards.</p>
        <p class="para">After making your selections, click Next to advance to the 
 next wizard page.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you select a value for Number of Levels in Each Standard Group that 
 is greater than the value you select for Number of Standards in Each Group 
 (in the Describe Standard Bracket wizard page), the Enter Level Details 
 page appears.</p>
