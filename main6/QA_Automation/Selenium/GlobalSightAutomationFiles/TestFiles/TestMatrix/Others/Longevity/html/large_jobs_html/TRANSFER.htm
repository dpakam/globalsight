        <h1>Bath 
 A or B transfer page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to define transfer parameters for Bath A and/or 
 Bath B. Dissolution media containing a dissolved sample is transferred 
 from each vessel to a corresponding transfer vial located in the 2690D/2695D 
 sample compartment.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 This page appears only when you selected the 2690D/2695D installed check 
 box in the Select Sample Set Method Type page of the Sample Set Method 
 wizard. If you did not select it, the only options are Removed Volume 
 and Replaced Volume.</p>
        <h2>Transfer volume</h2>
        <p class="para">Volume (in milliliters) of media (with dissolved sample) 
 to transfer from the dissolution vessel to each sample vial.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.1 to 1.5</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 0.8</p>
        <h2>Replace media</h2>
        <p class="para">Replaces the lost volume of media from the vessel. The removed 
 volume is replaced with new media at each sample transfer.</p>
        <h2>Additional volume (pre-sample rinse)</h2>
        <p class="para">To rinse sample probes and sampling lines before withdrawing 
 a sample, enter the volume (in milliliters) of media to withdraw as a 
 presample rinse. If you do not recirculate the media, the amount removed 
 is a combination of the presample rinse volume and the transfer volume. 
 </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 2.50 to 999.99</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Typical 
 entries:</span> 2.50 to 15.00</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default</span>: 
 7.50</p>
        <p class="para"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #425085;" class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Increasing presample rinse volume increases the minimum times between 
 sample transfers.</p>
        <h2>Rapid sampling</h2>
        <p class="para">Processes samples quickly. The minimum presample rinse volume 
 (2.50 mL) is withdrawn to rinse the sample probes and lines allowing you 
 to take the sample aliquot and transfer it to vials 1 minute after the 
 pill drop and every 2 minutes thereafter. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If selected, the presample rinse volume specified is used only for the 
 first transfer. Subsequent transfers use a rinse volume of 2.50 mL. </p>
        <h2>Recirculate media</h2>
        <p class="para">Returns the dissolution media to the dissolution vessels. 
 If not selected, the dissolution media withdrawn from a single-bath system 
 will go to waste. Recirculate media is available only in a single-bath 
 system.</p>
        <h2>Removed volume</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies volume (in milliliters) of media and dissolved 
 sample to remove from the vessel on each transfer. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.0 to 99999.99</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Typical 
 entries:</span> 0.0 to 20.0</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 0.0</p>
        <p class="para">If you have a 2690D/2695D, this field is disabled because 
 the system calculates the volume removed. The calculated removed volume 
 changes if the media is recirculated. The amount of sample transferred 
 to the vial also affects the calculated removed amount.</p>
        <p class="para">If you select Recirculate Media, the removed sample volume 
 equals the amount transferred to the vial. If not selected, the removed 
 volume equals the transfer volume of sample removed from the vial plus 
 the presample rinse volume.</p>
        <h2>Replaced volume</h2>
        <p class="para">If you selected Replace Media and have a 2690D/2695D, this 
 field is disabled because the system calculates the volume replaced (amount 
 of sample transferred to the vial plus the presample rinse volume). The 
 Removed Volume equals the Replaced Volume.</p>
        <p class="para">If you do not have a 2690D/2695D, enter the volume of media 
 (in milliliters) you want to replace after each transfer; otherwise, the 
 Replaced Volume is 0.00. </p>
