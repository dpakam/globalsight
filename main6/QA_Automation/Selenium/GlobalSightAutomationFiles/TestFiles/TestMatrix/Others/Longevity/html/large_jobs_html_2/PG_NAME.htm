        <h1>Name 
 tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to name a report group (in Report Publisher) 
 or a plot (in Review or Compare), and to save the contents as a report 
 group to the Empower database (if desired). </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 You cannot overwrite a Host Report Group in the database. You can, however, 
 overwrite a report group that is in this project, but not in the Host 
 database.</p>
        <h2>Group name</h2>
        <p class="para">Identifies the report group (in Report Publisher) or the 
 plot (in Review or Compare). Up to 30 alphanumeric characters (including 
 spaces) are allowed for the group name, but not special characters, such 
 as asterisks (*). </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 To save a report group to the Empower database, click Save Group to Database.</p>
        <h2>Save group to project</h2>
        <p class="para">Saves changes to the report group (in Report Publisher) or 
 the plot (in Review or Compare) and makes the report group available in 
 the Empower database for future use. If you are in the Report Publisher, 
 the new (saved) report group appears in the Report Groups tree. If a report 
 group with the same name exists, clicking Save Group to Project displays 
 a message indicating that you cannot overwrite the group. You must save 
 the group with a different name. If the report group or plot is new, or 
 you want to rename the item, clicking Save Group to Project saves changes 
 to the new or renamed plot or report group. If you are in Report Publisher, 
 the new report group appears in the Report Groups tree.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Attention:</span> 
 When modifying properties of an Empower database Field group, you cannot 
 overwrite the original field in the Empower database. These fields are 
 stored in the Empower database and cannot be replaced or overwritten. 
 If you attempt to overwrite the properties of a database field, Empower 
 software saves the existing and new versions of the field. Waters recommends 
 that if you modify a Field group, rename it.</p>
