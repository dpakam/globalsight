        <h1>Chromatograms 
 tab (Extraction plot)</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to specify the type of chromatogram extractions 
 to include in your report.</p>
        <h2>Extraction type</h2>
        <p class="para">Lists types of chromatogram extractions. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Extract 
 – Chromatogram to be extracted at a single wavelength (PDA) or mass (MS).</li>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">MaxPlot 
 – Extracted chromatogram in which each data point is plotted at its maximum 
 absorbance wavelength (PDA) or maximum intensity mass (MS).</li>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Total 
 – For PDA, an extracted chromatogram that averages absorbance values of 
 all wavelengths in a specified range. For MS, specifies an extracted chromatogram 
 that sums intensity values of all masses in a specified range.</li>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Ratio 
 – Extracted chromatogram that represents a ratio of the absorbance at 
 two wavelengths (PDA) or masses (MS).</li>
            <li class="listbull">TIC – Extracted chromatogram 
 that represents the sum of all ion intensities for each data point in 
 the mass range specified in the instrument method (MS).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 MaxPlot and Total plot labels that appear for the chromatogram extraction 
 use actual raw data limits instead of the channel description (from the 
 associated method set) to display the extraction. For example, if the 
 channel description is 190 to 800 nm in the method set, you might see 
 that the extraction plot label is 190 to 798 nm, which is the actual raw 
 PDA data. </p>
        <h2>Beginning WvlnMass, Ending WvlnMass</h2>
        <p class="para">Specific wavelengths (PDA data) or masses (MS data) of the 
 extracted chromatograms you want reported. </p>
        <h2>Threshold</h2>
        <p class="para">When the Ratio extraction type is selected, Threshold specifies 
 an absorbance threshold value for beginning and ending wavelengths. A 
 ratio is plotted only when the absorbance at both wavelengths exceeds 
 this threshold. Otherwise the ratio is not plotted. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.00001 to 9.99999&#160;AU</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 0.00100</p>
        <h2>Peak separation 1 (MS centroid data only)</h2>
        <p class="para">Enter a value to control the extraction tolerance when extracting 
 a specific mass in MS. This field is enabled only when the Extraction 
 Type is set to Ratio or Extract.</p>
        <h2>Peak separation 2 (MS centroid data only)</h2>
        <p class="para">Enter a value to control the extraction tolerance when extracting 
 a second specific mass in the ratio. This field is enabled only when the 
 Extraction Type is set to Ratio. </p>
        <h2>Apply to PDA channel</h2>
        <p class="para">Enables or disables the reporting of extracted chromatograms 
 for the associated PDA channel. </p>
        <h2>Apply to MS channel</h2>
        <p class="para">Enables or disables the reporting of extracted chromatograms 
 for the associated MS channel. </p>
