        <h1>LS 
 Calibration wizard - Normalization Constants page</h1>
        <p class="para">This page displays normalization constants, which are results 
 of the normalization procedure. The Channel, Geometric Angle (Degree), 
 and Description information is copied from the instrument method associated 
 with the current channel in Review. These fields are not editable. The 
 Description, Scattering Angle (Degree), and Normalization fields are editable. 
 If you selected Use existing calibration from the Initial LS Calibration 
 page, the Scattering Angle value displayed is from the chosen existing 
 calibration. If you selected Create a new calibration from the Initial 
 LS Calibration page, you must fill in the scattering angles provided by 
 the detector manufacturer.</p>
        <p class="para">For specific detectors, scattering angles can be calculated 
 using the solvent refractive index and, if you are using a Wyatt LS detector, 
 glass refractive index. If PD or Wyatt appears as the detector type on 
 the Detector and Solvent page, the Calculate button is enabled. You can 
 enter scattering angle values or click Calculate to calculate the actual 
 scattering angles in the solvent. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Scattering angles depend specifically on the LS detector configuration. 
 LS detector manufacturers provide scattering angles in commonly used solvents. 
 Calculated scattering angles are for reference, so verify that the calculated 
 scattering angles are correct.</p>
        <p class="para">The values in the Normalization field are the constants either 
 copied from the chosen existing calibration on the Initial LS Calibration 
 page or calculated from the isotropic standard(s) selected from the Normalization 
 Standard page. If the normalization constants are neither obtained from 
 the chosen existing calibration nor calculated from isotropic standard(s), 
 the Normalization value in the first row defaults to 1.0 and the values 
 in all other rows default to blank so you can enter the correct values.</p>
