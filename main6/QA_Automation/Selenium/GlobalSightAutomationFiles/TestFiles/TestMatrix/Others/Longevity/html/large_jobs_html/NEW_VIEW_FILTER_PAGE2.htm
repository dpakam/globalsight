        <h1>New 
 View Filter wizard - Conditions page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to set conditions (optional) in the view filter 
 columns to further filter data that is displayed in a view. A condition 
 typically consists of an operator (for example, &gt;) 
 and a reference value (for example, 1/23/2001) that, in combination, limit 
 the data that appears in the view to which the view filter is applied.</p>
        <h2>Conditions table</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays columns for Column Names (previously selected in 
 the first page) and up to five conditions that you can set for each Column 
 Name. </p>
        <p class="caption">To set view filter conditions (optional) for a Column 
 Name:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="listnum">Click the Condition 1 cell 
 in the row of a Column Name to which you want to add a condition. The 
 Create a Condition dialog box appears. </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;" class="listnum">If applicable, select an 
 operator (for example, Greater Than Equal) in the first field. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Some Column Names do not have an operator field (for example, Sample Type). 
 </p>
        <ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="listnum">In the next field, enter 
 or select a reference value (for example, 3/1/2001).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you select Between as an operator, the dialog box activates the second 
 reference field. Enter values in the two reference fields to set a range 
 for the search.</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li style="font-weight: normal;" class="listnum">Click OK. The dialog box 
 closes and the condition is added to the cell.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;" class="listnum">If you want to broaden 
 (logical OR) the search conditions for the column (for example, to search 
 for Broad Standards <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> Broad 
 Unknowns in a Sample Type column), repeat steps 1 to 4, but click the 
 next available Condition cell.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Rule:</span> 
 You can enter up to five conditions for a Column Name.</p>
        <ol start="6">
            <li style="font-weight: normal;" class="listnum">Repeat steps 1 to 5 for 
 each Column Name to which you want to add a condition.</li>
            <li class="listnum">Click Next. </li>
        </ol>
