        <h1>Peak 
 Ratio Plots</h1>
        <p class="para">You can select one of following choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Overlay peak ratios 
 (one peak per plot) by plotting one peak and its ratio peaks per plot</li>
            <li class="listbull">Overlay chromatograms 
 with all peak results by plotting a chromatogram, and any associated chromatograms 
 containing ratio peaks, for all the peaks in the result</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Example:</span> A result contains 
 two peaks, "caffeine" and "acetone", and each peak has associated peak ratios. If you overlay one peak per plot, the result 
 produces two plots, one for acetone and its associated ratio peaks, and 
 one for caffeine and its associated ratio peaks. The peaks are displayed 
 on the plot, not the chromatogram. If you overlay chromatograms, all chromatograms 
 are overlaid, including chromatograms containing the ratio peaks for 
 both acetone and caffeine.</p>
