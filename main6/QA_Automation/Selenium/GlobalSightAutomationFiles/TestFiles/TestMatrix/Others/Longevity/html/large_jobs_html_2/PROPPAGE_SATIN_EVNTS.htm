        <h1>Events 
 tab (busSAT/IN and busSAT/IN 2)</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to define operation and initiation of the selected 
 busSAT/IN Module event output channel (Channel 1 or Channel 2).</p>
        <h2>Events overview</h2>
        <p class="para">Enabling a busSAT/IN event output generates a contact closure 
 that initiates a process on another device (at a specified time after 
 the busSAT/IN event clock starts). The contact closure can control operation 
 of a fraction collector or chart recorder, or activate solvent/column 
 switching valves. </p>
        <p class="para">You can program up to eight event outputs in the Events table 
 rows. In each row, specify the time that the event is to occur, the event 
 function (On, Off, Pulse, Repeat Pulse), and the duration of pulsed events. 
 The Event Start parameter specifies when the Events table begins, either 
 On Injection or On Enable. </p>
        <p class="para">Events are specific to the busSAT/IN channel (Channel 1 or 
 Channel 2) that you selected.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Event outputs do not provide power to run the external device. You must 
 use an appropriate power supply to run the device.</p>
        <h2>Events enable</h2>
        <p class="para">Enables or disables the events in the Events table.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 Enabled or Disabled</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 Disabled</p>
        <h2>Event start</h2>
        <p class="para">When the Events table is to be triggered, which can occur 
 at one of the following times: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">On Enable 
 – Triggers the Events table when instruments are set to initial conditions.</li>
            <li class="listbull">On Injection – Triggers 
 the Events table when an injection occurs (default).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Events table columns</h2>
        <p class="para">Enter values in these columns to program output events for 
 an instrument connected to the Out terminal on the busSAT/IN Module.</p>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p class="para">When the event function occurs. Event rows are sorted by 
 time.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.00 to 650.00 min</p>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p class="para">Type of function. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">On – Turns on a contact 
 closure (relay switch). With this function, the switch provides a Low 
 position (low resistance) output that remains on until an Off function 
 is sent.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Off – Turns off the contact 
 closure (relay switch). With this function, the switch moves to the High 
 position (high resistance), and the contact closure is broken.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Pulse – Transmits one 
 On/Off pulse. With this function, the switch moves to the Low position 
 then to the High position. The contact closure (low resistance) is maintained 
 for the pulse width specified by the Interval parameter. The default pulse 
 width is 0.02 min.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Rep Pulse – Transmits 
 multiple On/Off pulses. The switch alternates between the High and Low 
 positions for the pulse width specified by the Interval parameter. Pulses 
 continue until an Off function is sent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interval</h3>
        <p class="para">Duration of a pulse event in minutes. You can access this 
 parameter only if you selected Pulse or Rep Pulse as the function. The 
 minimum pulse width is 0.02 minutes On and 0.02 minutes Off. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.02 to 100.00 minutes</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 0.02 minutes</p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p class="para">Description of the programmed event. The description can 
 be up to 256 characters in length.</p>
