 Set Method wizard – Describe Standard Injections page</h1>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Use this page of the Sample Set Method 
 Wizard to describe your narrow standard injections for a GPC or GPCV sample 
 set. You define the number of narrow or broad standard vials, the number 
 of injections from each vial, the injection volume, the run time, the 
 method set to be used, and so on. </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Use this page of the Sample Set Method

        <h2>Inject narrow standards</h2>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the use of narrow standards 
 in your GPC or GPCV sample set. Empower software uses narrow integration 
 parameters to detect and integrate the peak(s) in the chromatogram, uses 
 viscosity narrow integration parameters to integrate the viscometer channel 
 data (GPCV only), incorporates data from the integration results and sample 
 information into a calibration curve, and creates a viscosity law plot 
 for the calibration curve (GPCV only). When you enable this check box, 
 the remaining fields and controls in this page are activated. </p>

 injections.</p>
        <h3>Number of narrow standards</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the number of narrow standard vials for the sample 
 set. Valid entries: 1 to 99.</p>

        <p class="para">Specifies the number of broad standard vials for the sample 
 set. Valid entries: 1 to 99.</p>
        <h3>Number of injections per vial</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the number of injections from each standard vial. 
 Valid entries: 1 to 99.</p>
        <h3>Injection volume</h3>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the volume in microliters of 
 the injected sample, valid entries are 0.0 to 29999.9. Note the following 
 considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt;" class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Waters autosamplers, 
 small injector loops may omit the maximum volume. Ensure hardware configuration 
 is compatible with your desired injector size.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt;" class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Agilent 1100 autosamplers, 
 the maximum injection volume is the seat capillary volume, plus the syringe 
 size. Ensure that the hardware configuration is specified correctly in 
 your method.</li>

 if you specified Universal Calibration as a calibration technique when 
 you created your processing method. Valid entries are 0.000000000 to 2.000000000. 
 Leave this field set to the default of 1.000000000 if you specified Relative 
 Calibration as a calibration technique in your processing method.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> If you decide to run 
 multiple narrow standards in a vial, make sure that you enter the same 
 k value for each standard in a sample vial.</p>
        <h3>Alpha</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the optional Mark-Houwink constant, alpha, which 
 is the slope of the viscosity law plot. Enter a value in this field if 
 you specified Universal Calibration as a calibration technique when you
