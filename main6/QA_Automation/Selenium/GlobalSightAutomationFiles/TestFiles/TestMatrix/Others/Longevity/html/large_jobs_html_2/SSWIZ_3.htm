        <h1>New Sample 
 Set Method wizard – Select Location of Standards page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to define bracketing for your sample set by 
 selecting where standard injections occur relative to the samples. Note 
 that the diagram on the left side of the page, which provides a representation 
 of sample set bracketing, automatically adjusts its display of samples 
 and standards according to your selection. On this page, you also define 
 the starting position for vials in the sample loading tray.</p>
        <h2>Defining where standard injections occur</h2>
        <p class="para">You define where standard injections occur by selecting one 
 of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">No Standards 
 – Specifies that the sample set does not use standards.</li>
            <li class="listbull">At Start 
 of Sample Set – Specifies that standards are to be injected at the start 
 of the sample set. If you make this selection, you must load your standard 
 vials at the beginning of the tray (before your samples).</li>
            <li class="listbull">At Start 
 and End of Sample Set – Specifies that standards are to be injected at 
 the start and end of the sample set. Standard injections are averaged 
 together.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Throughout 
 Sample Set (average all) – Specifies that standards are to be injected 
 throughout the sample set, and all standards are to be averaged together.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Before 
 Each Sample Group – Specifies that standards are to be injected before 
 each sample group in the sample set.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Around 
 Each Sample Group (without overlap) – Specifies that standards are to 
 be injected at the start and end of each sample group in the sample set, 
 with no overlap of standards between successive groups. No overlap indicates 
 that separate standards are injected for each sample group. Standard injections 
 at the beginning and end of each sample group are averaged together, but 
 no averaging occurs between sample groups.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Around 
 Each Sample Group (with overlap) – Specifies that standards are to be 
 injected at the beginning and end of each sample group in the sample set, 
 with overlap of standards. Overlap indicates that standards injected at 
 the end of a sample group are used as standards at the beginning of the 
 next sample group. Standard injections at the beginning and end of each 
 sample group are averaged together, but no averaging occurs between sample 
 groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Start loading vials into tray position</h2>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the tray position number of 
 the first vial (standard or sample) in the sample set. Valid entries: 
 1 to 120 for the Waters 2690 and 2690D Separations Modules, 1 to 384 for 
 the Waters 2790 Separations Module (depending on the specified plate), 
 1 to 96 for Waters 717/717plus Autosamplers, 1 to 100 for the HP 5890 
 and 6890 GC autosamplers, and 1 to 999 for other non-Waters autosamplers.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Specifies the tray position number of 
 the first vial (standard or sample) in the sample set. Valid entries: 
 1 to 96 for Waters 717/717plus Autosamplers.</p>
        <p class="caption">Notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">If you are creating a 
 sample set method for plates, and have defined (in the previous wizard 
 page) the plate types to be used with the method, this field displays 
 the first vial/well location in the first plate position that you selected.</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">If you are creating a 
 dual tower GC sample set method, the tray position number is preceded 
 by F: (for front tower) or B: (for back tower).</li>
        </ul>
