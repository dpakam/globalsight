        <h1>eCord Information Properties</h1>
        <p class="para">You can report current and historical eCord information. 
 You can report column summary data and sample set data. If you choose 
 column summary data, the report includes this information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">eCord column ID, name, 
 part number, and serial number.</li>
            <li class="listbull">injection count, first 
 and last injection date, sample count, sample set count, maximum pressure, 
 maximum pressure date, maximum temperature, and maximum temperature date 
 over the life of the eCord information. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">The sample set data information reports all historical information 
 for sample sets acquired with eCord based on the eCord's serial number. 
 If you choose sample set data, the report includes this information about 
 the associated sample set and does not represent data over the life of 
 the eCord column: ID, eCord ID, sample set date and name, user name, system 
 name, injection count, sample count, maximum pressure, and maximum temperature.
