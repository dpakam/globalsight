        <h1>Archive 
 and Remove Records dialog box</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this dialog box to define how you want to save the audit 
 trail or project/sample archive records you are about to remove - you 
 can save them as binary or text files. If you choose to save them as text 
 files, you will not be able to restore them as offline records.</p>
        <p class="caption">To archive and remove the system audit trail or project/sample 
 archive records:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="listnum">Select the type of file 
 to create when archiving and removing the records: Binary or Text.</li>
            <li class="listnum">Select the date to archive 
 and remove <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> records created 
 before the specified date.</li>
            <li class="listnum">Click OK to access the 
 Save As dialog box.</li>
            <li class="listnum">Select the folder for the 
 archived files. Empower software supplies a file name for your archived 
 files that includes today's date. You can change this file name, but you 
 cannot change the file extension.</li>
            <li class="listnum">Click Save. If you choose 
 to save the archived records as text files, a message informs you that 
 you should archive the text file information to a secure location.</li>
            <li class="listnum">Click OK.</li>
