 Do not include calibration plots in report methods that you will use for 
 standards in Run and Report mode. The software updates calibration curves 
 for standards during processing. Therefore, standard calibration plots 
 printed during processing might include an incorrect number of points. 
 Calibration plots for unknowns are not updated during processing. To print 
 calibration curves, add the Report function after all standards in the 
 sample set or at the end of the sample set.</p>
        <h2>Data characteristics</h2>
        <p class="para">Determines what calibration curve data point information 
 is included in the plot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">All Points 
 – All points used to create the calibration curve.</li>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Averaged 
 Points – Averaged calibration data points on the Calibration Curve plot.</li>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Error 
 Range – Standard deviation for averaged data points on the calibration 
 curve.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Ignored Points – Points 
 that were specified to be ignored when calculating the curve.</li>
