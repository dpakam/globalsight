        <h1>New Sample 
 Set Method wizard – Enter Optional Information page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to enter optional standards/sample information. 
 Even if you choose not to enter or modify any of the parameters in this 
 page, they appear as columns in the Samples table listed with their default 
 values. The Enter Optional Information page contains the parameters described 
 below.</p>
        <h2>Sample weight</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays the factor used for adjusting the calculated component 
 amount to compensate for differences in the prepared solutions used for 
 calibration and analysis. The default value of 1.000 provides no factoring.</p>
        <p class="para">During calibration, the software <span style="font-style: italic;">multiplies</span> 
 the calculated amount of each standard component by the Sample Weight 
 value.</p>
        <p class="para">During quantitation, the software <span style="font-style: italic;">divides</span> 
 the amount read from the calibration curve (of the standard components) 
 by the Sample Weight value to calculate amounts for each unknown sample.</p>
        <h2>Dilution</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays the factor used for adjusting the calculated component 
 amount to compensate for differences in the prepared solutions used for 
 calibration and analysis. The default value of 1.000 provides no factoring.</p>
        <p class="para">During calibration, the software <span style="font-style: italic;">divides</span> 
 the calculated amount of each standard component by the Dilution value.</p>
        <p class="para">During quantitation, the software <span style="font-style: italic;">multiplies</span> 
 the amount read from the calibration curve (of the standard components) 
 by the Dilution value to calculate amounts for each unknown sample.</p>
        <p class="para">When you finish entering information into the table, click 
 Next to advance to the next wizard page.</p>
        <h2>Data start</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the time (in minutes) after injection start time 
 that data collection is to begin. Data Start allows you to delay the start 
 of acquisition to control the size of the datafile, and is useful for 
 eliminating eluent fronts from the file. Refer to the Data Start/Next 
 Injection Delay Sequence below.</p>
        <p class="caption">Notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">If your laboratory operates 
 under regulatory guidelines, verify with the applicable agency that you 
 can use this parameter.</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">If you are creating a 
 sample set method for dual tower GC operation, you must select the same 
 value for Data Start for both the Front and Back tower to allow for simultaneous 
 injections. To create a dual tower sample set method, you use the wizard 
 twice, once for each tower.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Next injection delay</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the delay time in minutes that is added to the 
 end of data acquisition and before the start of setup for the next injection. 
 Next Injection Delay allows you to wash away undesired peaks and stabilize 
 the conditions of a gradient run before the next injection. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Using the Data Start and Next Injection Delay options does not affect 
 timing of programmed gradient changes or timed events.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">If you are creating a sample set method 
 for dual tower GC operation, you must select the same value for Next Injection 
 Delay for both the Front and Back tower to allow for simultaneous injections. 
 To create a dual tower sample set method, you use the wizard twice, once 
 for each tower.</p>
        <p class="para">After making your selections, click Next to advance to the 
 next wizard page.</p>
