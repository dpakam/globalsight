        <h1>Events 
 tab (600)</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to program multiple events (both external and 
 internal) in the Events table. The external events are triggered by four 
 TTL output terminals (S1 through S4) on the rear panel of the 600 Series 
 Controller. The internal events are used to control the alarm, to change 
 reservoir sparge rates, and to change column heater temperature. Events 
 can be triggered more than once, and multiple events can be triggered 
 simultaneously.</p>
        <h2>Initial event states: switch1–switch4</h2>
        <p class="para">At the initial run conditions, enables or disables output 
 switches S1 through S4 for use as output events that control external 
 devices. See the <span style="font-style: italic;">600 Controller Installation 
 and Maintenance Guide</span> for instructions on connecting external devices 
 to the terminal strip.</p>
        <h2>Enable events</h2>
        <p class="para">Enables or disables the events in the Events table.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 Enabled or Disabled</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 Disabled</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 This option does not affect initial event states.</p>
        <h2>Events table columns</h2>
        <p class="para">Program operating parameters in these columns.</p>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p class="para">Time when the event starts. Event rows are sorted by time. 
 You can program different events to occur at once. </p>
        <h3>Event</h3>
        <p class="para">Type of event signal: one of the four TTL-level output switches 
 (S1 through S4), or one of the three internal events (alarm, sparge, temperature). 
 Choose from these event types to program up to 15 total events. You can 
 program the same event more than once. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Switch 
 1 through Switch 4 – Correspond to terminal strip positions S1–S4 on the 
 rear of the 600 Controller. Activating a Switch event triggers a TTL-level 
 contact closure for controlling an external device (a vacuum degasser, 
 for example). Select On, Off, or Pulse in the Function cell when you program 
 a Switch event.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Alarm 
 – Controls the internal alarm for the 600 Controller. When turned On, 
 the audible alarm sounds until it receives an Off signal. Select On, Off, 
 or Pulse in the Function cell when you program an Alarm event.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Sparge 
 – Specifies the sparge rate for each enabled reservoir in the 600 Controller. 
 You cannot change sparge rates for individual reservoirs. Enter a sparge 
 rate of 0 to 100 mL/min in the Value cell when you program a Sparge event. 
 Enable reservoirs and set the initial sparge rate in the Degas tab.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Temperature 
 – Specifies the temperature of the column heater in the slide-out drawer 
 of the Waters 600E, 616, 626, 625 LC, or ActION Analyzer. Enter a temperature 
 in <span style="font-family: Symbol;">°</span>C in the Value cell when you program a 
 Temperature event. See the Column Temp parameters in the Temperature tab 
 for entries.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p class="para">Function of the event. Function selections apply to the four 
 external switch events (S1–S4) and the internal Alarm event. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;" class="listbull">On – Turns 
 on an alarm or contact closure that triggers an external or internal event. 
 With this function, the contact closure remains closed until an Off function 
 is sent.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;" class="listbull">Off – 
 Turns off an alarm, or event contact closure for the event. With this 
 function, the contact closure is broken.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;" class="listbull">Pulse 
 – Transmits one On/Off pulse. The contact closure is maintained for 600 
 milliseconds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 There are no Function selections for the Sparge and Temperature events.</p>
        <h3>Value</h3>
        <p class="para">Value for the Sparge and Temperature event selections. The 
 sparge rate range is 0 to 100 mL/min. The temperature range depends on 
 the type of column heater and the ambient temperature. See the Column 
 Temp Set parameter in the Temperature tab for details.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 There are no Value selections for the S1–S4 and Alarm events.</p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p class="para">Description of the programmed event. The description can 
 be up to 256 characters in length.</p>
