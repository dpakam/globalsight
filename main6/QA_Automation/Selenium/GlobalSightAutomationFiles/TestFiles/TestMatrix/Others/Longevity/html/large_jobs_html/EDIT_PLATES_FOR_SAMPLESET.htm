 for Sample Set</h1>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">This dialog box appears when you click 
 Define Plates from the Sample Set Method wizard, or when you select the 
 Edit Plates tool or Plates command from the Edit menu in Run Samples, 
 the Sample Set Method Editor, or the Alter Sample window. </p>
        <p class="para">Use this dialog box to do these things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Select the pre-defined 
 plate types from which injections are to be made</li>

        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Displays the Waters 2790 plate layout 
 in the dialog box (the default setting). In this layout, the left section 
 of the dialog box displays the four-position 2790 plate carrier. When 
 deselected, the layout changes to a tabular view, typically used for autosamplers 
 or systems other than the Waters 2790.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Create New Plate Type button</h2>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Displays the New Plate Type dialog box, 
 where you can create a new plate for your system (typically created from 
 Configuration Manager).</p>
        <h2>Clear Plates button</h2>
        <p class="para">When you create a sample set method using the Sample Set 
 Method wizard, this button clears the dialog box of any selected plates, 
 allowing you to reselect plates, plate positions, and vial/well locations.</p>
        <p class="para">When you manually create or modify a sample set method, this 
 button displays a warning that continuing with the clear removes all injection 
 rows from the Samples table. This button also clears the Define Plates 
 for Sample Set Method dialog box of any selected plates, allowing you 
 to reselect plates, plate positions, and vial/well locations.</p>
        <h2>Plate Sequencing Mode buttons</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the injection order for the selected vials in the 
 displayed plate. This injection order of selected vials is transferred

 The Plate Sequencing Mode buttons have no effect on how the vials are 
 labeled (referenced). You set vial reference in the Referencing tab when 
 creating a plate type. Plate sequencing affects only the order of the 
 vials once inserted or appended into the Samples table. The Samples table 
 defines the vial injection order.</p>
        <h2>Plate type and position section</h2>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Select plate types and plate positions 
 in this section of the dialog box. You can create a new plate type from 
 this dialog box by clicking the Create New Plate Type button. Plate position 
 refers to the position of the plate within the autosampler.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Select plate types and plate positions 
 in this section of the dialog box. Plate types are usually created earlier 
 in Configuration Manager. However, you can create a new plate type from 
 this dialog box by clicking the Create New Plate Type button. Plate position 
 refers to the position of the plate within the autosampler.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">By default, this section of the dialog 
 box displays the Waters 2790 layout, showing the four possible plate positions 
 in the 2790 plate carrier. By deselecting the 2790 Layout check box, this 
 section switches to a tabular layout (typically used for autosamplers 
 or systems other than the Waters 2790). </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">You select the plate type (from the drop-down 
 list box) for each plate position from which injections are to be made. 
 When you select a plate type, the plate/vial section to the right displays 
 a graphical view of the plate and vials. Plate position is designated 
 by the first number in the Vial (or Plate/Well) column of the Samples 
 table.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">In either layout, you select the plate

 Plate position is designated by the first number in the Vial (or Plate/Well)
