        <h1>New Sample 
 Set Method wizard – Describe Samples page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to define information about your samples. The 
 Describe Samples page contains the fields and controls described below.</p>
        <h2>Sample information section</h2>
        <p class="para">Use this section to define information about your sample 
 injections.</p>
        <h3>Number of samples</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the total number of sample vials in the tray. The 
 software determines the maximum number of samples you can enter in this 
 field according to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Previously entered New 
 Sample Set Method Wizard parameters (for example, parameters that define 
 standard vial locations, number of standard vials in a group, and so on).</li>
            <li class="listbull">The capacity of your 
 autoinjector or autosampler tray or carousel.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Number of injections per vial</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the number of injections to be taken from each 
 sample vial.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Valid entries:</span> 
 1 to 99</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are creating a sample set method for dual tower GC operation, you 
 must select the same value for Number of Injections per Vial for both 
 the Front and Back tower to allow for simultaneous injections. To create 
 a dual tower sample set method, you use the wizard twice, once for each 
 tower.</p>
        <h3>Injection volume</h3>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the volume in microliters of 
 the injected sample, valid entries are 0.0 to 29999.9. Note the following 
 considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Waters autosamplers, 
 small injector loops may omit the maximum volume. Ensure hardware configuration 
 is compatible with your desired injector size.</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Agilent 1100 autosamplers, 
 the maximum injection volume is the seat capillary volume, plus the syringe 
 size. Ensure that the hardware configuration is specified correctly in 
 your method.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Specifies the volume in microliters of 
 the injected sample, valid entries are 0.0 to 29999.9. </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze"><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> Small injector loops may omit the 
 maximum volume. Ensure hardware configuration is compatible with your 
 desired injector size.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Agilent GCs, valid entries are 1 
 to 5 units. Each unit corresponds to 10 percent of syringe capacity. For 
 example, 2 units of a 25 microliter syringe is 10 microliters. So entering 
 2 will cause a 10 microliter injection. However, if you are using the 
 optional nanoliter adaptor, these percentages change. Please consult the 
 manufacturer’s documentation to determine the correct setting for injection 
 volume.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are using a 2690D/2695D, creating a Dissolution Sample Set Method, 
 and pooling injections, the pool volume and injection volume must be equal.</p>
        <h3>Run time</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the length of time in minutes to collect data for 
 a sample. Valid entries are 0 to 650.0.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are creating a sample set method for dual tower GC operation, you 
 must select the same value for Run Time for both the Front and Back tower 
 to allow for simultaneous injections. To create a dual tower sample set 
 method, you use the wizard twice, once for each tower.</p>
        <h3>Maximum # of samples per group</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the maximum number of samples in a sample group. 
 This field appears only if you chose to inject standards before or around 
 sample groups (in the Select Location of Standards page). The software 
 determines the maximum number you can enter in this field according to 
 your Number of Sample selection and the capacity of your autoinjector 
 or autosampler tray or carousel. The value you enter for Number of Samples 
 is divided by the value for Maximum # of Samples Per Group to determine 
 the number of sample groups for your sample set. </p>
        <p class="para">For example, if you entered a value of 25 for Number of Samples, 
 and 6 for Maximum # of Samples Per Group, your sample set would contain 
 a total of five sample groups—four groups containing six samples, and 
 one group containing one sample.</p>
        <h3>Options button</h3>
        <p class="para">Displays the Enter Optional Information page, where you can 
 specify a Sample Weight factor, a Dilution factor, a Data Start time and 
 a Next Injection Delay time.</p>
        <h2>Method set section</h2>
        <p class="para">Use this section to define or create the method set used 
 to acquire, process, and/or report data for your samples.</p>
        <h3>Select</h3>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the method set used to acquire, 
 process, and/or report data for the samples (this could be the same or 
 a different method set from the one you selected in the previous wizard 
 page for acquiring, processing, and/or reporting standards). Select the 
 appropriate method set from the drop-down list. If you are using the Pro 
 interface, click Create New if you need to create a new method set. </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Specifies the method set used to acquire, 
 process, and/or report data for the samples (this could be the same or 
 a different method set from the one you selected in the previous wizard 
 page for acquiring, processing, and/or reporting standards). Select the 
 appropriate method set from the drop-down list. </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are creating a sample set method for dual tower GC operation, you 
 must select the same method set for both the Front and Back tower. To 
 create a dual tower sample set method, you use the wizard twice, once 
 for each tower.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Create new button (Pro interface only)</h3>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Displays the first page of the New Method 
 Set Wizard, where Empower software interactively leads you through the 
 steps to create a new method set. </p>
        <p class="para">After making your selections, click Next to advance to the 
 next wizard page. </p>
