        <h1>Timed Groups 
 tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to group all components in a start and stop 
 time range (specified in the Timed Groups table) and analyze this group 
 as a single component. The resulting single component is identified under 
 the Name field of the Timed Groups table. The calculated response, area, 
 height, and amount for the group are listed in the Peaks table (in the 
 Results window) under the timed group and identified as Group in the Type 
 field.</p>
        <p class="para">If required, these system can calibrate the response of the 
 entire group named in the Name field against the calibration curve of 
 the component in the Curve Reference field (in the Components table). 
 The system quantitates all detected components known and unknown within 
 the defined time window by comparing them to the Curve Reference component. 
 </p>
        <h2>Timed groups table</h2>
        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p class="para">Up to 30 alphanumeric characters (including spaces) for the 
 name of the timed component group. </p>
        <h3>Start, stop</h3>
        <p class="para">Time window (in minutes) that includes all peaks in the chromatogram 
 that you want grouped. If you leave the Stop time cell blank, Empower 
 software groups all peaks to the end of the run.</p>
        <h3>Source of X value</h3>
        <p class="para">Source of the calibration curve data point’s amount or concentration 
 for the timed component group. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">User Entered 
 – Reads the amount or concentration for the calibration curve point for 
 the Timed Group from the sample (as entered during sample loading) or 
 from the Default Amounts tab. </li>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Sum Peaks 
 – Calculates the amount and concentration for the calibration curve point 
 for the Timed Group as the sum of the values (amounts and concentrations) 
 of all peaks in the group.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Notes:</span> 
 If you select User Entered and have not entered default amounts or concentrations 
 for the timed group being calibrated, enter this information in the Default 
 Amounts tab (of the Processing Method window).</p>
        <p class="para">You can override the Source of X Value field by selecting 
 a component as a Curve Reference in the Components table (Components tab). 
 Empower software uses the identified Curve reference component’s calibration 
 curve and ignores the Source of X Value field.</p>
        <h3>Exclude known peaks</h3>
        <p class="para">Exclude from the group all known (named) peaks found in the 
 region of the timed group. The check box is cleared by default to include 
 all known peaks in the group.</p>
