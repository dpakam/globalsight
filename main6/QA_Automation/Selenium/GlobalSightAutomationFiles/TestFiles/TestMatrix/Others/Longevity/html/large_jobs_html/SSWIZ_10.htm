        <h2>Run mode</h2>
        <p class="para">Choose from the following run modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Run Only – Acquires data 
 without processing the data or printing a report. Interactive system suitability 
 operating mode is effectively disabled.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Run and Process – Acquires 
 and processes data (using the processing method in the method set) without 
 printing a report.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Run and Report – Acquires 
 and processes data (using the processing method in the method set), and 
 prints a report, or you can print a report from the Samples table – it 
 does not have to be in the Method Set. The software prints any reports 
 of the processed data, depending on the type of report method included 
 in the associated method set.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Interactive system suitability</h2>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Empower software allows you to select 
 an interactive system suitability operating mode during acquisition and 
 processing (this mode does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> 
 require installation of the System Suitability option). This selection 
 provides you with fault detection functionality similar to that provided 
 in the System Suitability option (for example, to stop acquisition if 
 a specified "must" peak in the processing method is not detected 
 during processing). The following selections are available from the drop-down 
 list:</p>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">
            <li class="listbull">Continue on Fault – Continues 
 to make injections and/or acquire data even if a Fault condition occurs 
 during processing (default).</li>
            <li class="listbull">Reinject on Fault – Stops 
 acquiring data and repeats the current injection if a Fault condition 
 occurs during processing. Injections are repeated as many times as you 
 specify in Customize Defaults. If the reinjection also results in a Fault, 
 acquisition is stopped.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Stop on Fault – Stops 
 acquisition when a Fault condition occurs during processing.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Next Sample on Fault 
 – Skips to next sample when a Fault condition occurs during processing.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Next Sample Set on Fault 
 – Skips to next sample set when a Fault condition occurs during processing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Both Stop on Fault and Reinject on Fault selections add extra time to 
 the injection process. These selections instruct Empower software to wait 
 until the current injection is processed and checked for faults before 
 performing the next injection. Fault checking occurs for each Run Mode 
 selection.</p>
