        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">When backing up single 
 projects, the software displays a warning box whenever an error occurs. 
 You must respond to the warning before the backup continues.</li>
            <li class="listbull">When backing up multiple 
 projects at the same time (batch backups), the software completes the 
 process and generates a log file which is located in the Empower\Logs 
 directory. Errors encountered while backing up multiple projects do not 
 interrupt the back up process. The back up process is halted only when 
 it encounters errors that cause the project to be deleted or cause the 
 back up to fail. </li>
