 Sample Set Method Wizard - Method Validation Tests</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to select the validation tests that you want 
 to turn on, off, or hide in the sample set method that you are creating. 
 </p>
        <p class="para">For each validation test, select one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">To hide the column in 
 the Sample Set Method Editor, click Hidden.</li>
            <li class="listbull">To turn on this validation 
 test by default for all rows in the sample set method, click On.</li>
            <li class="listbull">To turn off this validation 
 test by default for all rows, but display it as a column in the Sample 
 Set Method Editor, click Off.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> When you modify the sample set 
 method in the Sample Set Method Editor, you can modify these selections 
 by adding or removing columns for the validation tests in the Samples 
 table. &#160;</p>
