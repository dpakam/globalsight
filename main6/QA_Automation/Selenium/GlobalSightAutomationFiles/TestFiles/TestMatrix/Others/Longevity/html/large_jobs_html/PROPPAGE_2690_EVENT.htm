        <h1>Events 
 tab (2690/2695, 2690D/2695D, and 2790/2795)</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to program multiple events (both external and 
 internal) in the Events table. The external events are triggered by four 
 TTL output terminals (S1–S4) on the 2690/2695, 2690D/2695D, or 2790/2795 
 Module. The internal events are used to control the alert (internal alarm), 
 to change reservoir sparge rates (2690/2695 and 2690D/2695D), sample compartment 
 temperature, column heater temperature, and column position (2690D/2695D 
 and 2790/2795), and toggle an optional Column Regeneration Valve in the 
 2690D/2695D and 2790/2795. Events can be triggered more than once and 
 multiple events can be triggered simultaneously.</p>

        <h2>Events table columns (programmable events)</h2>
        <p class="para">Program operating parameters in these columns.</p>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p class="para">Time when the event starts. Event rows are sorted by time. 
 You can program different events to occur at once. </p>
        <h3>Event</h3>
        <p class="para">Type of event signal: one of the four TTL-level output switches 
 (S1–S4), or one of the internal events (alert, sparge, column heater temperature, 
 sample compartment temperature, column position, or toggle). Choose from 
 these event types to program up to 15 total events. You can program the 
 same event more than once. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Switch 
 1 through Switch 4 – Corresponds to terminal strip positions S1–S4 on 
 the rear of the separations module. Activating a Switch event triggers 
 a contact closure for controlling an external device. Select On, Off, 
 Pulse, Toggle, or No Change in the Function cell when programming a Switch 
 event.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Alert – Controls the 
 audible alert for the separations module. When turned On, the audible 
 alert sounds until it receives an Off signal. Select On, Off, or No Change 
 in the Function cell when programming the Alert event.</li>
        </ul>

 and 2690D/2695D only) – Sparge rate for reservoirs in a separations module. 
 Enter a sparge rate of 0 to 100 mL/min in the Value cell when programming 
 a Sparge All event. Set the initial sparge rate in the Degas tab.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Sparge A to Sparge D 
 (2690/2695 and 2690D/2695D only) – Sparge rate for the selected reservoir

 effect, set the initial sparge rate in the Degas tab.</li>

 Temperature of an optional column heater. Enter a temperature in °C in the Value cell when programming the Column 
 Heater Temperature event. </li>

 Temperature of an optional sample compartment heater/cooler. Enter a temperature 
 in °C in the Value cell when programming the 
 Sample Compartment Temperature event.</li>

            <li class="listbull">Toggle (2690D/2695D and

        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p class="para">Function of the event. Function selections apply <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> 
 to the four external switch events (S1–S4). Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">On – Turns on a contact 
 closure that triggers an external or internal event. With this function, 
 the contact closure remains closed until an Off function is sent.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Off – Turns off the contact 
 closure for the event. With this function, the contact closure is broken.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Pulse – Transmits one 
 On/Off pulse. The contact closure is maintained for the number of minutes 
 that you set in the Value column. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Toggle – Changes the

        <h3>Value</h3>
        <p class="para">Value for the Event and/or Function selections you make for 
 the row. For example, if you selected Column Temp as the Event, you would 
 set a temperature value (in °C) in the Value cell. If you selected Switch 
 1 for the Event and Pulse for the Function, you would set a pulse length 
 (in seconds) in the Value cell.</p>
