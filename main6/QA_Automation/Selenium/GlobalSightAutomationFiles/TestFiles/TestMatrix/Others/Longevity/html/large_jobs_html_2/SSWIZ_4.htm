        <h1>New Sample 
 Set Method wizard – Specify Calibration Options page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to select your method of calibration, using 
 either standard vials that each contain a different concentration of standard, 
 or a single standard vial from which the autoinjector makes injections 
 of varying volumes. In addition, you define where your standard vials 
 are located: in a group at the beginning of the tray, or before the start 
 of each sample bracket. You define your calibration options from the selections 
 described below.</p>
        <h2>Standard levels section</h2>
        <p class="para">Use this section to define your calibration method.</p>
        <h3>Each standard vial contains a different level standard</h3>
        <p class="para">Make this selection when you have a single standard vial 
 for single-level calibration, or when you have multiple standard vials, 
 each with a different concentration.</p>
        <h3>Different standard levels are created with different injection volumes 
 using an Autoinjector</h3>
        <p class="para">Make this selection when you use the autoinjector or autosampler 
 to make injections of varying volumes from a standard vial.</p>
        <h2>Location of standards in tray section</h2>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Use this section to define where your 
 standard vials are located in the tray. If you chose Dissolution method 
 type, you will not see this section. If you selected No standards or at 
 start of sample set in the Select Locations of Standards page, these options 
 will be disabled.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Use this section to define where your 
 standard vials are located in the tray. </p>
        <h3>All standards are located at the beginning of the Autosampler tray 
 </h3>
        <p class="para">Make this selection when all your standard vials are located 
 at the beginning of the tray (before your samples). </p>
        <h3>Separate groups of standard vials are located throughout the Autosampler 
 tray</h3>
        <p class="para">Make this selection when you have separate groups of standards 
 positioned before each group of samples. </p>
