 when the view filter is applied. This is the default selection and is 
 designated by an empty cell.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Hide – 
 Specifies that data within the view table column not be sorted and hides 
 the column when you apply the view filter. Any conditions specified within 
 a hidden column are applied to the view table even though the column is 
 hidden.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Ascend 
 – Sorts information, such as sample names, alphabetically from A to Z, 
 numerically from smallest to largest, and by date. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Ascend/Hide

 view table. Although hidden, the column is used in the sorting process.
