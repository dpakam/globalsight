        <h1>Purity 
 tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to specify Spectral Contrast parameters and 
 Peak Purity testing parameters.</p>
        <h2>Spectral contrast parameters</h2>
        <p class="para">These parameters control how spectra are compared for Peak 
 Purity and spectrum Library Matching. You set them using the top pane 
 of the Purity tab.</p>
        <h3>Wavelength limit (nm) start, stop</h3>
        <p class="para">Start and stop wavelengths (in nanometers) for Spectral Contrast 
 processing. Use the Wavelength Limit parameters to exclude from Spectral 
 Contrast calculations regions of a spectrum where there is no component 
 absorbance or where the solvent strongly absorbs. These regions do not 
 contribute to spectrum Library Matching or Peak Purity testing. To optimize 
 Peak Purity testing using wavelength ranges, click.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you leave the wavelength limits at the default range (190 to 800 nm), 
 the software uses the starting and ending wavelengths of the acquired 
 wavelength range as the Wavelength Limit.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 190.0 to 800.0&#160;nm</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Defaults:</span> 
 Start, 190.0; Stop, 800.0</p>
        <h3>Noise interval time (min) start, stop</h3>
        <p class="para">Start and stop times (in minutes) for the noise interval, 
 which is used for spectrum Library Matching or Peak Purity testing. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.00 to 655.90</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Defaults:</span> 
 Start, 0.25; Stop, 0.75</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Empower software requires a noise interval to calculate the Threshold 
 Angle.</p>
        <h2>Purity parameters</h2>
        <p class="para">Purity parameters control the Peak Purity measurement. Peak 
 Purity testing refers to a computation that uses a single pass of all 
 spectra in a peak to detect a coelution within a peak. Multicomponent 
 Peak Purity testing refers to a computation that uses multiple passes 
 to detect one or more coelutions within a peak. </p>
        <h3>Purity enabled</h3>
        <p class="para">Peak Purity testing is performed on all peaks identified 
 during integration. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 Disabled</p>
        <h3>Active peak region (%)</h3>
        <p class="para">Region of each peak over which you want to perform Peak Purity 
 testing. Entries: 0.0 to 100.0%, where 100% is the width of the peak from 
 liftoff to peak center and from peak center to touchdown. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 100%</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Leave the active peak region parameter set to the default value of 100% 
 to enable Peak Purity testing throughout the whole elution range of the 
 peak.</p>
        <h3>Threshold criteria</h3>
        <p class="para">Estimates the noise and/or solvent contributions to the Purity 
 Angle of a spectrum during Peak Purity testing, and flags purity results 
 that exceed this threshold. Choices: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">AutoThreshold 
 – Empower software calculates the Noise Angle (based on the Noise Interval 
 you specify) and the Solvent Angle (based on the absorbance of the peak), 
 then adds the two angles to compute the Threshold Angle for each peak.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Noise 
 + Solvent – Adds the Solvent Angle to the Noise Angle. You must fill in 
 the Solvent Angle field.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Noise 
 – Reports and uses only the Noise Angle, which is calculated for each 
 peak based on total system performance and the peak’s height, ignoring 
 solvent contribution.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Solvent – Reports and 
 uses only the Solvent Angle. You must fill in a value in the Solvent Angle 
 field.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solvent angle (degrees)</h3>
        <p class="para">Estimates the solvent contribution to Spectral Contrast. 
 </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.00 to 90.00</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 1.0</p>
        <h3>Purity passes</h3>
        <p class="para">Number of times the software performs Peak Purity testing 
 on a peak, basing the next purity pass on the apex and maximum impurity 
 spectra from each pass. For each purity pass, the software calculates 
 a new Purity Angle and Purity Threshold, as well as a new Purity and Noise 
 plot. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 1 to 4</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span>
