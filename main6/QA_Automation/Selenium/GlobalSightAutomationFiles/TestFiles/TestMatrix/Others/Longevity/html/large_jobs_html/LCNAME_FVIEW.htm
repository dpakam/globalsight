        <h1>Named Groups 
 tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to group components in the Components table 
 whose peaks are to be analyzed as a single peak. The software sums the 
 peak areas and heights of the components under a new named group to produce 
 the results for the group. The calculated response, area, height, and 
 amount for the group are in the Peaks table (in the Results window) under 
 the named group and identified as Group in the Type field.</p>
        <p class="para">If required, the system can calibrate the response of the 
 entire group named in the Name field against the calibration curve of 
 the component in the Curve Reference field (in the Components table). 
 The system quantitates all detected components known and unknown within 
 the defined group comparing them to the Curve Reference component. </p>
        <h2>Named groups tree</h2>
        <p class="para">The individual peak components in the Single Peak Components 
 tree on the left side of the tab and the named components group. Named 
 groups are added only after you identify the component group in the Name 
 column (of the Named Groups table).</p>
        <p class="para">Fill a selected named group by either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Dragging the individual 
 components from the Single Peak Components tree to the appropriate named 
 group in the Named Groups tree. The components are added to the Named 
 Groups list.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Right-clicking the Named 
 Groups tree, then selecting Fill With All Components. All components from 
 the Single Peak Components tree are added under the Named Groups tree 
 list.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 To remove one or more components from the Named Groups tree, select the 
 components to be removed, right-click the tree, then select Delete.</p>
        <h2>Named groups table</h2>
        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p class="para">Up to 30 alphanumeric characters including spaces for the 
 name of the component group. This name appears under the Named Groups 
 tree at the left side of the tab. </p>
        <h3>Reported RT</h3>
        <p class="para">Reported retention time for the named component group. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">None – 
 No retention time is reported.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">First 
 Peak – First peak in the group.</li>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Last Peak 
 – Last peak in the group. If a processing method contains a named group 
 with a “last peak” for reported RT, the last peak on the list is used 
 to integrate and quantitate regardless of the retention time order of 
 the components.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Largest 
 Area – Peak with the largest calculated area in the group.</li>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">Largest 
 Height – Peak with the largest calculated height in the group.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Source of X value</h3>
        <p class="para">Source of the calibration curve data point’s amount or concentration 
 for the named component group. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" style="font-weight: normal;">User Entered 
 – Reads the amount or concentration for the calibration curve point for 
 the Named Group from the sample (entered during sample loading in Run 
 Samples or Alter Samples) or from the Default Amounts tab. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Sum Peaks – Calculates 
 the amount and concentration for the calibration curve point for the Named 
 Group as the sum of the values (amounts and concentrations) of all of 
 the peaks in the group.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Notes:</span> 
 If you select User Entered and have not entered default amounts or concentrations 
 for the named group being calibrated, enter this information in the Default 
 Amounts tab (of the Processing Method window). </p>
        <p class="para">You can override the Source of X Value field by selecting 
 a component as a Curve Reference in the Components table (Components tab). 
 Empower software uses the identified Curve reference component’s calibration 
 curve and ignores the Source of X Value field.</p>
