        <h1>New Sample 
 Set Method wizard – Identification pag</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to enter information that identifies standards 
 and samples in your sample set. This page contains the fields described 
 below.</p>
        <h2>How should your standards be identified?</h2>
        <p class="para">Your standards are identified through the following selections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">SampleName – Specifies 
 the identifier for your standards. Once you finish creating the sample 
 set method, this identifier appears in the SampleName column of the Samples 
 table. The default identifier, Std, is automatically assigned by the software 
 as an identifier for all standards in the SampleName field. The SampleName 
 custom field is a default custom field that is provided with the software. 
 If you make an entry in the Default field for the SampleName custom field 
 (in Configuration Manager), the entry replaces Std as the SampleName identifier.</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">SampleName – Specifies 
 the identifier for your standards. Once you finish creating the sample 
 set method, this identifier appears in the SampleName column of the Samples 
 table. The default identifier, Std, is automatically assigned by the software 
 as an identifier for all standards in the SampleName field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paraindent" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 This page of the wizard appears once for each sample identifier custom 
 field (default and user-created). For example, if you create a sample 
 identifier custom field called LotNumber, this page appears and displays 
 LotNumber as the name of the field.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Incrementing Prefix – 
 Specifies an incrementing prefix (letter or number) for the standard identifier 
 specified in the SampleName field. Letters increment alphabetically; numbers 
 increment numerically.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you mix letters and numbers in a prefix, be aware that the software 
 increments only the last group of like characters. For example, if the 
 prefix is AB12, the software increments the numbers from 12 to 13 and 
 leaves the letters alone.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Incrementing Suffix – 
 Specifies an incrementing suffix (letter or number) for the standard identifier 
 specified in the SampleName field. Letters increment alphabetically; numbers 
 increment numerically.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you mix letters and numbers in a suffix, be aware that the software 
 increments only the last group of like characters. The software will automatically 
 alphabetize custom sample identifiers.</p>
        <h2>How should your samples be identified?</h2>
        <p class="para">Your samples are identified through the following selections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">SampleName – Specifies 
 the identifier for your samples. Once you finish creating the sample set 
 method, this identifier appears in the SampleName column of the Samples 
 table. The default identifier, Unk, is automatically assigned by Empower 
 software as an identifier for all samples in the SampleName field. The 
 SampleName custom field is a default custom field that is provided with 
 the Empower software. If you make an entry in the Default field for the 
 SampleName custom field (in Configuration Manager), the entry replaces 
 Unk as the SampleName identifier.</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">SampleName – Specifies 
 the identifier for your samples. Once you finish creating the sample set 
 method, this identifier appears in the SampleName column of the Samples
