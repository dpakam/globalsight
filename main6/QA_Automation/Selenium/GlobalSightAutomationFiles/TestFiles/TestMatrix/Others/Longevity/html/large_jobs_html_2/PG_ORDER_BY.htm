        <h1>Order 
 By tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to define sorting order within an individual 
 report group and within a composite group. </p>
        <h2>Available fields list</h2>
        <p class="para">Fields in the Empower database available for sorting. Click 
 an item to view the list of available fields, then double-click (or drag) 
 the desired field. The field is added to the Ordered List. To remove a 
 field from the Ordered List, click the icon in the first column (of a 
 row) to select the entire row, then click <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;&lt;</span>. 
 </p>
        <p class="para">You might be allowed to select items to order by that are 
 not supported for a particular report group. If the sorting order appears 
 to have no affect, then verify that the selected item is meaningful to 
 the data you are using.</p>
        <h2>Ordered list</h2>
        <p class="para">Sorting order of selected database fields. The field at the 
 top of the Ordered List has the highest priority. You define the sort 
 order (ascending or descending) from the list in each cell in the Sort 
 Order column. Based on that selection, the fields in the list appear in 
 the report in ascending or descending order. For example, if you chose 
 Ascending, all June results are reported before July results; injection 
 1 is reported before injection 2, and so on. Fields from all groups are 
 displayed in the Ordered List, whether you print them or not (for example, 
 you can order by date, but do not print the date).</p>
        <p class="para">Rows are sorted within the primary sort according to subsequent 
 fields in the Ordered List. Numeric fields are sorted from smallest to 
 largest number. Alphabetic fields are sorted from A to Z. For example, 
 if you include Peak Name in the Row Order list, rows are sorted by Peak 
 Name, with remaining columns unsorted. If you include Peak Name and Retention 
 Time in the Row Order list, rows are sorted by Peak Name and then in order 
 of Retention Time for each peak name.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Column data is first sorted by order of numbers (0 to 9, 9 to 0), then 
 by uppercase letters (A to Z, Z to A), and finally by lowercase letters 
 (a to z, z to a).</p>
        <p class="para">Use the Move Up or Move Down buttons to rearrange the sorting 
 order of the selected fields in the Ordered List by moving the selected 
 item up or down one row at a time (and moving the remaining rows up or 
 down one row). To move a row, click the icon in the first column (of a 
 row) to select the entire row, then click Move Up or Move Down.</p>
        <h2>Group by (Table, LC calibration point table, and GPC calibration point 
 table report groups)</h2>
        <p class="para">When defining sorting order for columns in a table, LC Calibration 
 Point table, or GPC Calibration Point table, you can define the grouping 
 of rows in the table by specifying a row from the Group By list. The items 
 in this list represent the database fields included as columns in the 
 Table Template in the Table tab. The Group By list increases or decreases 
 based on the originating table. During reporting, individual tables are 
 generated for the Group By selection. Every time the identified Group 
 By value changes, Empower software starts a new table. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 The Group By function is not supported in LC Calibration Average Point 
 tables and GPC Distribution tables.</p>
        <p class="para">During sorting and ordering, table row order occurs by the 
 selections in the Ordered List, then by the selection in the Group By 
 list. It is strongly recommended that you choose a field in the Group 
 By list that is also included in the Ordered List. This ensures that the 
 data in the resulting table occurs in a logical (and not random) order. 
 For the example above (which groups by peak name), you might produce more 
 tables than expected if you do not also specify to order by peak name 
 to ensure that peaks with the same name are consecutive in the table before 
 grouping.</p>
