        <h1>General 
 Tab (User)</h1>
        <p class="para">You can modify your own password (unless this is an LDAP 
 user account) and set your own table and plot preferences without the 
 Alter Users privilege. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Restriction:</span> System is a 
 permanent user that cannot be deleted from the database. The System account 
 is always a Local Authentication user account.</p>
        <h2>User Name</h2>
        <p class="para">Name of the selected user.</p>
        <h2>Full Name<span style="font-weight: normal;"> <![CDATA[ ]]></span></h2>
        <p class="para">Complete name of the selected user. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> 
 This field is optional. However, if the user needs to sign off results 
 in Preview, you must make an entry in this field. The field can also be 
 used to print a user's name on a report. You need the Alter Users privilege 
 to modify this field.</p>
        <h2>Account Status</h2>
        <p class="para">Current condition of the selected user account. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Active 
 – Specifies that the selected user account is operating normally.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Disabled – Specifies 
 that the selected user account was deactivated by the software and cannot 
 be used to log in to Empower software. This status appears in the Users 
 View table when, for example, a user exceeds the allowable number of login 
 attempts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> 
 If the number of user accounts with a status of Active or Disabled exceeds 
 the number of licenses installed, then change the status of a user to 
 Removed before creating a new user. If you cannot remove a user, you must 
 buy additional licenses.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Removed – Specifies that 
 the selected user account was deleted from the current database and the 
 account cannot be used to log in to Empower software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paraindent"><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> 
 When you delete a user and Enforce Unique User Account Names is selected 
 in the System Policies dialog box, Removed appears in the User Status 
 column of the Users View table. A user with Administrator privileges can 
 later activate a user account with a status of Removed. This is useful 
 if, for example, a user terminates employment at your company and is rehired 
 three months later.</p>
        <h2>LDAP user accounts</h2>
        <p class="para">If you have LDAP Authentication enabled (View &gt; System 
 Policies &gt; Authentication Policies) the password fields are disabled 
 because it is controlled by LDAP and not by Empower software.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Exception:</span> When the Always 
 Local Login check box is selected, the password fields are enabled because 
 this user account is a Local account and not an LDAP account.</p>
        <h2>LDAP User DN</h2>
        <p class="para">The LDAP user distinguished name is supplied by the LDAP 
 server. If you want to associate a different LDAP user name with this 
 Empower user account, click Search LDAP. You cannot modify this field.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> This field displays 
 when the user account is controlled by LDAP authentication and the Always 
 Local Login check box was not enabled.</p>
        <h2>Password Required</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies that the selected user must enter a password when 
 logging in to Empower software. This password affects the ability for 
 a user to sign off results in Preview.</p>
        <h2>Always Local Login</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies that the user account is always a Local account 
 even though LDAP authentication is enabled. When this check box is selected 
 and LDAP Authentication is enabled, this user account is still governed 
 by the User Account Policies (Accounts and Passwords) tab in the System 
 Policies dialog box and not the policies on the LDAP Server. If this check 
 box is not selected and LDAP Authentication is enabled, the user account 
 must be associated with an LDAP account so that the user can log in to 
 Empower software.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Tip:</span> This field does not 
 display for any user accounts when in LDAP authentication mode.</p>
        <h2>Current Password</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies your current password. To change your password, 
 ensure the Password Required check box is selected. Enter a new password 
 in New and Confirm Password field. </p>

 by your system policies (up to 30 characters).</p>
        <h2>Confirm New Password</h2>

 choice of password.</p>
        <h2>User Must Change Password at Next Login</h2>

 </h2>

 displays seven days prior to the expiration date for time-based AQT licenses.

 box. </p>
