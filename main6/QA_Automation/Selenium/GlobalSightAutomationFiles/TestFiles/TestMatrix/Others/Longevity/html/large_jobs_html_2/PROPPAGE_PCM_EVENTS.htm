        <h1>Events 
 tab (PCM/15XX)</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to program up to 11 timed external event outputs 
 on the PCM.</p>
        <h2>Events overview</h2>
        <p class="para">A PCM event generates a relay output on the PCM that initiates 
 a process on another device at a specified time. This output could turn 
 on a column heater, control operation of a fraction collector or chart 
 recorder, or activate a column switching valve. </p>
        <p class="para">You can program up to 11 ev-0\]ent outputs in the Events table. 
 Define the time that each event is to occur, the event types (Relay or 
 Event), the event function (On, Off, Pulse, Repeat Pulse), and the interval 
 of pulsed events.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Event outputs do not provide power to run the external device. Use an 
 appropriate power supply to run the device.</p>
        <h2>Enable events</h2>
        <p class="para">Enables or disables events in the Events table.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 Enabled or Disabled</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 Disabled</p>
        <h2>Events table columns</h2>
        <p class="para">Program operating parameters in these columns to define output 
 events for an instrument connected to the Event or Relay terminals on 
 the rear of the PCM.</p>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p class="para">Specifies the time that the event function occurs. Event 
 rows are sorted by time. </p>
        <h3>Event</h3>
        <p class="para">Event output terminal. Choose from the two Relay outputs 
 and four Event outputs to program up to 11 total event outputs. You can 
 program the same output more than once. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt;" class="listbull">Relay 1 and Relay 2</li>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt;" class="listbull">Event 1, Event 2, Event 
 3, and Event 4</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 To maintain similarity with the SIM, the output connections on the PCM 
 are divided into two sets of terminal connections. Connections are labeled 
 Event 1 through 4 and Relay 1 and 2. All six connections are relay connections 
 that provide contact closures (not TTL outputs).</p>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p class="para">Type of function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">On – Turns on a contact 
 closure (Relay or Event type). With this function, the switch provides 
 a Low position (low resistance) output that remains on until an Off function 
 is sent.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Off – Turns off the contact 
 closure (Relay or Event type). With this function, the switch moves to 
 the High position (high resistance), and the contact closure is broken.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Pulse – Transmits one 
 On/Off pulse. With this function, the switch moves to the Low position 
 then to the High position. The contact closure (low resistance) is maintained 
 for the pulse width specified by the Interval parameter. The default pulse 
 width is 0.02 min.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Rep Pulse – Transmits 
 multiple On/Off pulses. The switch alternates between the On and Off positions 
 for the pulse width specified by the Interval parameter. Pulses continue 
 until an Off function is sent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interval</h3>
        <p class="para">Duration (in minutes) of a pulse event. You can access this 
 parameter only if you selected Pulse or Rep Pulse as the function. The 
 minimum pulse width is 0.02 minutes On and 0.02 minutes Off.</p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p class="para">Description of the programmed event. The description can 
 be up to 256 characters in length.</p>
