        <h1>Plot 
 Font Preferences Tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to define the format of text in Empower plots 
 on screen and in print. You can select the font, font size, color, and 
 so on. Modifications made here affect all plots in Empower software. However, 
 you can override these plot font preferences in individual Empower applications 
 (for example, Review and Report Publisher).</p>
        <h2>Font to Edit</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays the individual plot components whose fonts can be 
 modified.</p>
        <p class="para">To format the font of a plot component, click the option 
 button of the component you want to format, then define the font family, 
 size, style, and color (see below) in the Characteristics section of the 
 tab.</p>
        <p class="para">You must edit individually each plot component whose font 
 can be modified. You can, however, format each component differently from 
 each other.</p>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p class="para">Defines the format of the font in the selected plot component. 
 Choices: Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikeout, Name (font), Size (points), 
 and Text Color. Available font families and sizes depend on which fonts 
 are installed in your computer.</p>
        <p class="para">To change the plot component color, click Text Color to access 
 the Color dialog box. You can use all colors supported by the Windows 
 operating system, which includes basic and custom colors. Default: Black.</p>
