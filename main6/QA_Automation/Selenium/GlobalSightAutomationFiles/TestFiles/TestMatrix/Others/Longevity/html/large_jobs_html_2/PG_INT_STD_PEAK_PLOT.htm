        <h1>Peak 
 Plot tab</h1>
        <p class="para">When using an internal standard, use this tab to select the 
 type of plot to display on the report.</p>
        <h2>Overall peak with internal standard (1 peak/plot)</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays one peak per plot with the internal standard peak 
 overlaid.</p>
        <p class="para">Each plot will have the peak from the chromatogram with its 
 internal standard peak, whether the internal standard is from the same 
 channel or a different one. If you select this option and three peaks 
 in the chromatogram have an internal standard, then three plots appear 
 in the report.</p>
        <p class="para">You cannot obtain a plot for the peak if your data meets 
 the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">A peak is not quantitated 
 using an internal standard</li>
            <li class="listbull">The processing method 
 used to obtain the result cannot be loaded</li>
            <li class="listbull">The internal standard 
 chromatogram cannot be loaded</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Overlay chromatogram with all internal standards</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays the entire chromatogram with all associated internal 
 standard chromatograms overlaid. </p>
        <p class="para">You cannot obtain a plot if your data meets the following 
 criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">A chromatogram does not 
 contain any peaks that use an internal standard</li>
            <li class="listbull">The processing method 
 used to obtain the result cannot be loaded</li>
            <li class="listbull">None of the internal 
 standard chromatograms can be loaded</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Missing internal standard peak</h2>
        <p class="para">When you are missing the internal standard peak, it may be 
 due to one of the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">If the internal standard 
 peak chromatogram cannot be loaded, the peak appears as a missing peak 
 from the same channel as the main peak.</li>
            <li class="listbull">If the internal standard 
 is missing from the channel it is from, it appears as a missing peak from 
 that channel.</li>
        </ul>
