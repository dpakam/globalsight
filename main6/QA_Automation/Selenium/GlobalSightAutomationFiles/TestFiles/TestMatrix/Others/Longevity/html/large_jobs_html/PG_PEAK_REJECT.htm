        <h1>Peaks 
 tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to define the peak information to be reported 
 in a custom report group.</p>
        <h2>Use peak types</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays these peak types when a peak field is in the table:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Unknown 
 Peaks – Unknown peaks (a peak that cannot be identified during calibration). 
 These peaks are labeled Unknown in the Type column of the Result table 
 (Review) or in the report. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Missing 
 Peaks – Peaks not found in the chromatogram but listed in the Calibration 
 table (Review). These peaks are labeled Not Found in the Type column of 
 the Result table (Review) or in the report.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Internal 
 Std Peaks – Internal standard peaks found in a chromatogram. These peaks 
 are labeled Int Std in the Type column of the Result table (Review) or 
 in the report. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Known 
 Peaks – Peaks identified in the Component table (Review) and found in 
 the chromatogram. These peaks are labeled Found in the Type column of 
 the Result table (Review) or in the report.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Group 
 Peaks – Peak groups, determined by the Group table in the processing method 
 (Review). These peaks are labeled Group in the Type column of the Result 
 table (Review) or in the report.</li>
            <li class="listbull">AIA Peaks – AIA peaks 
 from imported results (peaks without baseline information, only area, 
 retention time, height, and amounts). These peaks are labeled AIA in the 
 Type column of the Result table (Review) or in the report.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If a selection is disabled, no information for the associated peak type 
 appears in the table.</p>
        <h2>Area rejection</h2>
        <p class="para">Minimum criteria for reporting peaks. Area Rejection applies 
 to the entire custom report table. Information for peaks below the specified 
 area rejection value(s) is not displayed in the custom report table.</p>
        <p class="para">You can specify these types of area rejection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Do Not Use Peaks With 
 an Area Less Than – Peaks with areas below the entered value are not reported. 
 </li>
            <li class="listbull">Do Not Use Peaks With 
 a %Area Less Than – Peaks with a percent area below the entered value 
 are not reported. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 Leaving one or more parameters blank disables area rejection.</p>
