        <h1>New Sample 
 Set Method wizard – Enter Level Details page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to further define standard level information 
 by modifying cells in the table. This page appears whenever you select 
 both of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Different Standard Levels 
 Are Created with Different Injection Volumes Using an Autoinjector (in 
 the Specify Calibration Options wizard page). </li>
            <li class="listbull">A value for Number of 
 Levels in Each Standard Group that is greater than the value you select 
 for Number of Standards in Each Group (in the Describe Standard Bracket 
 wizard page).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">The table on this page contains the columns described below.</p>
        <h2>Vial (or plate/well for systems configured with plates)</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays the vial numbers for the standards in the group. 
 Note the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">The vial numbers in the 
 column are automatically generated by an Empower algorithm. Modify the 
 numbers according to your requirements.</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">The vial numbers in the 
 column are automatically generated by a Breeze algorithm. Modify the numbers 
 according to your requirements.</li>
            <li class="listbull">If you previously selected 
 All Standard Vials Are Located at the Beginning of the Autosampler Tray 
 (in the Specify Calibration Options page), the vial numbers displayed 
 in the column reflect <span style="font-style: italic;">actual</span> 
 vial number positions in the tray. If you previously selected Separate 
 Groups of Standard Vials Are Located Throughout the Autosampler Tray (in 
 the Specify Calibration Options page), the vial numbers displayed in the 
 column reflect the relative position of the standard vials in each group 
 of standards.</li>
            <li class="listbull">The Number of Levels 
 in Each Standard Group parameter defines the number of vials displayed 
 in the column. For example, if you select two levels in each group, the 
 Vial column displays two vial numbers, each corresponding to a different 
 injection volume.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Injection volume (µL)</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays cells where you can enter a different injection 
 volume (in microliters) for each level of standard.</p>
        <h2>Level</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays the different standard levels for the sample set. 
 The levels correspond to the value you chose for Number of Levels in Each 
 Standard Group.</p>
        <h2>Sample weight</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays the factor used for adjusting the calculated component 
 amount to compensate for differences in the prepared solutions used for 
 calibration and analysis. The default value of 1.000 provides no factoring.</p>
        <p class="para">During calibration, the software <span style="font-style: italic;">multiplies</span> 
 the calculated amount of each standard component by the Sample Weight 
 value.</p>
        <p class="para">During quantitation, the software <span style="font-style: italic;">divides</span> 
 the amount read from the calibration curve (of the standard components) 
 by the Sample Weight value to calculate amounts for each unknown sample.</p>
        <h2>Dilution</h2>
        <p class="para">Displays the factor used for adjusting the calculated component 
 amount to compensate for differences in the prepared solutions used for 
 calibration and analysis. The default value of 1.000 provides no factoring.</p>
        <p class="para">During calibration, the software <span style="font-style: italic;">divides</span> 
 the calculated amount of each standard component by the Dilution value.</p>
        <p class="para">During quantitation, the software <span style="font-style: italic;">multiplies</span> 
 the amount read from the calibration curve (of the standard components) 
 by the Dilution value to calculate amounts for each unknown sample.</p>
        <p class="para">When you finish entering information into the table, click 
 Next to advance to the next wizard page.</p>
