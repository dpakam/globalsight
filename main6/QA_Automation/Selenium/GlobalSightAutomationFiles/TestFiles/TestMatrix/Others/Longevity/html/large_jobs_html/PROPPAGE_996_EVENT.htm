        <h1>Events 
 tab (2996 PDA)</h1>
        <p class="para">
            <MadCap:concept term="Lamp" />Use this tab to program time-based changes to the two detector 
 event output signals and the lamp. Using the Events table, you can program 
 up to 15 parameter changes during a run. Each parameter can be changed 
 more than once.</p>
        <h2>Events table columns</h2>
        <p class="para">Events table Time, Event Out Number, Event, and Comments 
 columns define output events for an instrument connected to the Event 
 Out 1 or Event Out 2 terminal on the 2996 PDA Detector, or turn the lamp 
 on or off.</p>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p class="para">Time after an injection when an event is to change. Event 
 rows are sorted by time.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.00 to 650.00 min</p>
        <h3>Event out number</h3>
        <p class="para">Which event is affected.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 Event Out 1, Event Out 2, or Event Lamp</p>
        <h3>Event</h3>
        <p class="para">Type of event function. Choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">On 
 – Turns on the lamp or turns on an event. The lamp or event remains on 
 until an Off event is sent.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Off 
 – Turns off the lamp or turns off an event.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Pulse 
 – Transmits a single On/Off pulse of predefined length to an external 
 device. Pulse cannot be used to control the lamp. </li>
            <li class="listbull">Rep Pulse 
 – Transmits multiple On/Off pulses of predefined lengths to an external 
 device. Pulses continue until an Off event is sent. The Rep Pulse option 
 cannot be used to control the lamp.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you use the 2996 PDA Detector within 4 hours of its last use, do not 
 turn off the lamp. There is no benefit in turning off the lamp for fewer 
 than 4 hours.</p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p class="para">Description of the programmed event. The description can 
 be up to 256 characters in length.</p>
