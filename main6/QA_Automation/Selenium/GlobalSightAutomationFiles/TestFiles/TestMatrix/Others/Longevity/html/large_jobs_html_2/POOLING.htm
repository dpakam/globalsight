        <h1>Bath 
 A or B Pooling page</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this page to enter sample pooling parameters for Bath 
 A or B. This page appears only when you selected a Dissolution option 
 and the 2690D/2695D installed check box in the Select Sample Set Method 
 Type page.</p>
        <p class="para">In pooling, an aliquot is drawn from each vessel and transferred 
 to its corresponding vials in the sample compartment. A small sample amount 
 from each vial to be pooled is drawn into the sample loop and injected 
 as one sample onto the column. Pooling saves time because samples are 
 not analyzed separately.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 The total amount of pooled sample collected in the sample loop cannot 
 exceed the size of the sample loop. For example, six samples of 10 <span style="font-family: Symbol;">m</span>L totals 60 <span style="font-family: Symbol;">m</span>L which 
 is drawn into the sample loop. The standard sample loop size is 100 <span style="font-family: Symbol;">m</span>L.</p>
        <h2>Pool injections</h2>
        <p class="para">Enables the pooling of samples and thus the remaining fields 
 are enabled. </p>
        <h2>Pooled vessels numbers</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the vessel numbers or vessel ranges from which 
 samples are drawn from the vial, and pooled before they are injected on 
 the column. The allowable range is from 1 to either 6 or 8. Separate the 
 vessel ranges with commas, for example, 1–6, or 1–8, or 1,3,5–8.</p>
        <h2>Sample vial amount</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the volume (in microliters) of sample added to 
 each vial.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you have a 2690D/2695D, the sample vial amount to be pooled must match 
 the injection volume as specified on the next page of the Sample Set Method 
 wizard (Sample Info page).</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 1.0 to 9999.9</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Typical 
 entries:</span> 0.00 to 1.5</p>
        <h2>Interval between pooling and injecting</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the amount of delay time (in minutes) to wait before 
 injecting the samples after pooling is complete. The interval or delay 
 time allows the sample to diffuse in the sample loop.</p>
