        <h1>Derived Channels 
 - Second channel tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to define the right side of the derivation equation 
 for the second data channel. A description of the data channel appears 
 at the bottom of the tab.</p>
        <h2>Operator</h2>
        <p>Specifies the mathematical function that combines the two data channels. 
 If no second channel or constant is specified, set this parameter to None. 
 When using a two-channel viscometer, set this parameter to (P1+2K*P2+B)/(P1–2K*P2+B).</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 None, +, –, x, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">¸</span>, or (P1+2K*P2+B)/(P1–2K*P2+B).</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 None.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span>

 two-channel viscometer, click.</p>
        <h2>Constant</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the mathematical constant to apply to the second 
 data channel (right side of the equation).</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 –9999.999 to 9999.999 mV.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 1.000 mV.</p>
        <p class="para">You can add a data offset to a single channel by entering 
 an operator and a constant in the Second Channel tab and leaving the Channel 
 list empty (no second channel selected). For example, to subtract a constant 
 of 123.3&#160;mV from the first data channel (data channel 1), select 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">–</span> from the Operator list, enter 
 123.3 in the Constant text box, and leave the Channel list empty for the 
 second data channel. The software subtracts 123.3 mV from each data point 
 in the first channel to produce the resulting derived channel. </p>
        <h2>Channel</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the type of data channel selected from the list, 
 which includes 2D channels, PDA: Single Wavelength (see below), and MS: 
 Single Mass (see below). You can also enter the name of a named channel 
 using the exact spelling of the name. Default: Blank.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you enter a channel name instead of selecting one from the list, it 
 must be the name of an existing derived channel or one you derived and 
 then saved. You cannot extract a chromatogram without a derived channel.</p>
        <h3>PDA: single wavelength</h3>
        <p class="para">Allows you to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the PDA 
 extraction type specified in the First (Only) Channel tab by a second 
 single wavelength from the same PDA data file. When you select PDA: Single 
 Wavelength in the Second Channel tab, a Wavelength text box appears where 
 you enter a wavelength value.</p>
        <h3>MS: single mass</h3>
        <p class="para">Allows you to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the first 
 MS channel by a second single mass from the same MS data file. Only single 
 mass extractions are allowed in the second channel portion of derived 
 channels. You must complete the following entries.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Mass:</span> 
 Specifies the mass to extract.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Peak Separation:</span> 
 Defines a tolerance range or "window" that is used when extracting 
 a chromatogram from a 3D MS data set. The values of the window are defined 
 as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull">Upper range: all masses 
 &lt; [mass + (0.5 x peak separation value)]</li>
            <li class="listbull">Lower range: all masses 
 <span style="font-family: Symbol;">³</span> [mass – (0.5 x peak separation value)] </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">The intensity value used in the chromatogram is the sum of 
 all peaks in the window (greater than or equal to the lower value and 
 less than the upper value). If no peaks fall in the range, the intensity 
 value is 0.</p>
        <p class="ind-Normal">The peak separation value is expressed in daltons. 
 The default is 1.0 daltons. </p>
        <h2>From injection labeled</h2>
        <p class="para">Specifies the labeled injection associated with the second 
 data channel. You must enter the exact name of the labeled injection in 
 the field to the right of the check box. You label a channel using the 
 Label column of the Samples table in Run Samples or the Sample Set Method 
 Editor (pre-acquisition), or the Alter Sample window (post-acquisition).
