        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">When you select Inject 
 Narrow Samples, Empower software: uses narrow integration parameters to 
 detect and integrate the peak(s) in the chromatogram, uses viscosity narrow 
 integration parameters to integrate the viscometer channel data (GPCV 
 only), quantitates the integration results (calculates peak molecular 
 weight) using a calibration curve, and calculates the intrinsic viscosity 
 of the peak (GPCV only).</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">When you select Inject 
 Narrow Samples, Breeze software: uses narrow integration parameters to 
 detect and integrate the peak(s) in the chromatogram, and quantitates 
 the integration results (calculates peak molecular weight) using a calibration 
 curve.</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">When you select Inject 
 Broad Samples, Empower software: uses broad integration parameters to 
 detect and integrate the peak(s) in the chromatogram, uses viscosity broad 
 integration parameters to integrate the viscometer channel data (GPCV 
 only), quantitates the integration results (calculates peak molecular 
 weight averages and slice weights) using a calibration curve, and calculates 
 the intrinsic viscosity of the distribution and peak and the branching 
 index g' (GPCV only).</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">When you select Inject 
 Broad Samples, Breeze software: uses broad integration parameters to detect

 using a calibration curve.</li>
            <li class="listbull">When you select Inject 
 No Samples, your sample set method includes only Inject Narrow Standard

 parameters in this page of the wizard are grayed out.</li>

        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the volume in microliters of 
 the injected sample, valid entries are 0.0 to 29999.9. Note the following 
 considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Waters autosamplers, 
 small injector loops may omit the maximum volume. Ensure hardware configuration

            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">For Agilent 1100 autosamplers, 
 the maximum injection volume is the seat capillary volume, plus the syringe 
 size. Ensure that the hardware configuration is specified correctly in 
 your method.</li>

        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Specifies the maximum number of samples 
 in a sample group. This field appears only if you chose to inject standards 
 before or around sample groups (in the Select Location of Standards page). 
 Empower software determines the maximum number you can enter in this field 
 according to your Number of Sample selection and the capacity of your 
 autoinjector or autosampler tray or carousel. The value you enter for 
 Number of Samples is divided by the value for Maximum # of Samples Per 
 Group to determine the number of sample groups for your sample set. </p>
