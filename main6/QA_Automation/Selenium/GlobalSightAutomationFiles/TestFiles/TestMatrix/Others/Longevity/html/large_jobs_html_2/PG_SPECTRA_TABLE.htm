        <h1>Spectral 
 Table tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to define the presentation of spectra (PDA or 
 MS) when printed in a report.</p>
        <h2>Table title</h2>
        <p class="para">Title displayed above the table. The table title can have 
 up to 250 alphanumeric characters without restrictions. If multiple lines 
 are required, press Ctrl+Enter to force the title onto multiple lines. 
 </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 When you specify a table title, ensure it is not wider than the potential 
 table width. If the title is longer than the generated table, the title 
 is truncated. Avoid this problem by shortening the title or forcing it 
 onto multiple lines.</p>
        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <p class="para">Position of the title above the table. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 Left Alignment, Center Alignment, Right Alignment</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 Center Alignment</p>
        <h2>Spectral range</h2>
        <p class="para">Minimum and maximum values (in nm or m/z) of the spectra 
 to include in the Spectra table. All spectral points outside this range 
 are not included in the report. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 Data dependent</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 Blank</p>
        <h2>Spectral characteristics</h2>
        <h3>Spline (PDA)</h3>
        <p class="para">Turns cubic splining on and off to enhance the spectral display 
 (PDA). When a spectrum is splined, it reappears as a spectrum that extends 
 from its ideal low wavelength to its ideal high wavelength with a resolution 
 of 0.2 nm, regardless of its actual wavelengths and resolution. The interpolated 
 points are calculated by performing a cubic spline operation. A low-resolution 
 spectrum that was splined can produce a more accurate wavelength of maximum 
 absorbance. </p>
        <h3>Baseline correct (PDA and MS)</h3>
        <p class="para">Compares spectra with or without baseline correction (PDA 
 and MS). You can perform baseline correction only if the spectra are within 
 peak limits.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 MS continuum data never has negative intensities, even after performing 
 baseline subtraction.</p>
        <h3>Derivative</h3>
        <p class="para">Number of times the derivative algorithm is applied to the 
 spectra. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 None, First, Second, Third, or Fourth </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 None</p>
        <h3>Smoothing</h3>
        <p class="para">Controls the level of smoothing by specifying the length 
 of the Savitsky-Golay filter applied to the spectra for both smoothing 
 and derivatives. Use the lowest smoothing number possible to avoid over 
 distortion of the spectra. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 None, and odd values (except 1 and 3) None to 31 </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 None</p>
        <p class="para">Smoothing is not performed if the number of points in the 
 spectrum is less than the smoothing number plus 5.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If Smoothing is set to None, setting Derivative to First, Second, Third, 
 Fourth applies a smoothing number of 5.</p>
        <h3>MS noise threshold</h3>
        <p class="para">Removes noise from spectral data before a library search. 
 The threshold value is applied as a percentage of the Base Peak intensity. 
 Mass intensity values in the sample spectrum that are less than the Threshold 
 value are set to 0. During a library search, the PBM algorithm ignores 
 the ion masses with intensity values of 0. You can apply the Threshold 
 parameter to any spectrum in Spectrum Review, then view the result in 
 the Spectral plot or in your report. </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Entries:</span> 
 0.000 to 100.000 </p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Default:</span> 
 0.100</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 The Threshold parameter does not permanently affect the original spectral 
 data.</p>
