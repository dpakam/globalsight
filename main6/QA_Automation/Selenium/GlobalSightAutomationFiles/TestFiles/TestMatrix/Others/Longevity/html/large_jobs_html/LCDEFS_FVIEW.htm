        <h1>Default Amounts 
 tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to enter single or mult-ilevel default amounts 
 or concentrations for the components being calibrated with the associated 
 processing method. The Default Amounts table in this tab allows you to 
 create a multilevel calibration curve without entering amounts in the 
 Component Editor each time you create a sample set. </p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Amounts entered during 
 component loading override values specified in the Default Amounts table.</li>
            <li class="listbull" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Amounts or concentrations 
 entered during component loading override values specified in the Default 
 Amounts table.</li>
            <li class="listbull">Use the Default Amounts 
 table to enter a set of component values that you use when your standards 
 are being calibrated. These values become part of the associated processing 
 method. When the values used for a standard differ from these entered 
 values, you can change the component values in the Component Editor (Run 
 Sample, pre-acquisition) or the Alter Samples window (post-acquisition).

        <h3>Level</h3>
        <p class="para"><span MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">All samples identified 
 with the same level receive the same default amount. </span><span MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">All 
 samples identified with the same level receive the same default amount 
 or concentration. </span>The software matches the level in the sample 
 with the level in this field to match the set of amounts or concentrations 
 with the sample. Enter up to 30 alphanumeric characters (for example 1, 
 2, 3; One Two, Three; Low Medium, High). Use the same Level designations 
 during sample loading.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are performing single-level calibration, enter one set of amounts 
 for the default level 1. Do not enter a level during sample loading; the 
 software matches these amounts with your standards. If you enter levels 
 during sample loading, they must match the levels in the Default Amounts 
 tab.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower"><span class="emphasisbold">Note:</span> 
 If you are performing single-level calibration, enter one set of amounts/concentrations 
 for the default level 1. Do not enter a level during sample loading; the 
 software matches these amounts/concentrations with your standards. If 
 you enter levels during sample loading, they must match the levels in 
 the Default Amounts tab.</p>

        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Breeze">Amount of the associated component in 
 the chromatogram. Entries must be in decimal notation (any nonnegative 
 number).</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">Amount or concentration of the associated

 nonnegative number).</p>
