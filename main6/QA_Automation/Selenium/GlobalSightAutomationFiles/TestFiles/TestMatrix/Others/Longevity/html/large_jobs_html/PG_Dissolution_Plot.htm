        <h1>Dissolution 
 Plot tab</h1>
        <p class="para">Use this tab to specify the format of the Dissolution plot 
 printed in a report. The x-axis of the Dissolution plot is always transfer 
 time.</p>
        <h2>Y-axis</h2>
        <p class="para">Y-axis data units of the Dissolution plot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;" class="listbull">Amount 
 Released – Amount of component that is dissolved.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;" class="listbull">Percent 
 Released – Percent of the claimed amount of component that is dissolved.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Format</h2>
        <p class="para">Plot type(s) to use in the dissolution plot. You can include 
 multiple plots in a Dissolution plot report group.</p>
        <p class="para"><span class="emphasisbold">Choices:</span> 
 Scatter Plot, Line Plot. </p>
        <p class="para">Average All Vessels – Average value of all vessels per transfer 
 time. If you choose this option, multiple injections per vessel are averaged 
 for a specific transfer time. This value is then averaged with the other 
 vessels for the same transfer time. </p>
        <p class="para">Plot Min/Max Points – If you are averaging all vessel transfer 
 times, select this check box to plot the minimum and maximum points for 
 each transfer time.</p>
        <h2>Include in plot</h2>
        <p class="para">Dissolution information to include in the report:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;" class="listbull">Infinity 
 Point – Infinity point in the Dissolution plot (assuming that the Infinity 
 test is enabled for the associated sample set method). The Infinity point 
 appears along the x-axis of the Dissolution plot as the last data point. 
 If the Infinity point is displayed in a Line plot, it appears as a square 
 at the end but not connected to the remainder of the Line plot. Empower 
 software supports one Infinity point for each bath.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;" class="listbull">Q 
 Factor Point – Percent of component that is expected to dissolve after 
 a specified time (for example 70% at 50 minutes). The Q Factor Point appears 
 as an ellipse on the plot and is labeled with the percentage or the amount 
 (depending on the Y-Axis setting). If Amount Released is specified, the 
 Q Factor Point (which is originally entered in the sample set method as 
 a percent) is converted by the software to an amount. The software displays 
 one Q Factor Point for each bath (for each component tested).</li>
            <li class="listbull">Claimed Amount – Nominal 
 amount of component in the dosage form claimed by the manufacturer’s label, 
 for example, 50 mg. The Claimed Amount appears in the Dissolution plot 
 legend. The software displays one Claimed Amount for each bath (for each 
 component tested).</li>
            <li class="listbull">Line to Origin – If Line 
 Plot is selected as the format for the Dissolution plot, you can select 
 this field to draw a line from the origin to the first transfer time. 
 </li>
        </ul>
