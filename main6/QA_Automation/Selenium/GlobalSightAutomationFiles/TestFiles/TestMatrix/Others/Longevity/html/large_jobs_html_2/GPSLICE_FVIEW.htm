 dn/dc is the change in refractive index over the change in concentration

 of the peak, assuming you have calibrated your RI detector using a narrow 
 standard peak with known dn/dc and exact concentration. When you have 
 two or more peaks in the same sample with different dn/dc values and you 
 know that the peaks have different refractive indexes, you might have 
 to enter dn/dc in the Slicing table. This instructs the software to calculate 
 an appropriate concentration for the peak. </p>

 You can enter a dn/dc value in the Slicing table for broad unknown and 
 standard peaks, not for narrow standard peaks. For narrow standards, enter 
 the dn/dc in the Weight Loading table of either the Component Editor or 
 Alter Sample window. For unknowns (broad or narrow), you can also enter 
 a single dn/dc value during sample loading or in the Alter Sample window.<br /><br />For the calculation of dn/dc and concentration for GPCV data, fill in the 
 RI Sensitivity field in the Samples table of Run Samples. Enter 1.0 if 
 the "gain" for the RI detector never changes or enter the current 
 setting from the RI detector to ensure that the numbers calculated are 
 accurate.</p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">The RI detector response for the narrow 
 standard peak, along with its dn/dc and exact concentration, is used to 
 calculate the RI Calibration Constant in the Peaks table of the Review 
 Main window and Results window. The RI Calibration Constant (which is 
 the change in refractive index divided by the change in detector response) 
 is used to calibrate the RI detector response to obtain an absolute number. 
 Otherwise, the concentration can be calculated for samples where only 
 the dn/dc is known. With an absolute RI detector response, dn/dc can be 
 calculated for samples where the concentration is known. </p>
        <p class="para" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Empower">If you do not know the dn/dc value and 
 have already calibrated your RI detector and calculated an RI Calibration 
 Constant, enter a concentration during sample loading. Empower software

 "Calculated dn/dc" peak field is checked. </p>
